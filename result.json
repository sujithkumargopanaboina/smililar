In general, adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection can be grouped into the followingseverity of illness categories; however, the criteria for each category may overlap or vary across clinicalguidelines and clinical trials, and a patient\u2019s clinical status may change over time.Asymptomatic or Presymptomatic Infection: Individuals who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 usinga virologic test (i.e., a nucleic acid amplification test [NAAT] or an antigen test) but who have nosymptoms that are consistent with COVID-19.Mild Illness: Individuals who have any of the various signs and symptoms of COVID-19 (e.g.,fever, cough, sore throat, malaise, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of tasteand smell) but who do not have shortness of breath, dyspnea, or abnormal chest imaging.Moderate Illness: Individuals who show evidence of lower respiratory disease during clinicalassessment or imaging and who have an oxygen saturation (SpO2) \u226594% on room air at sea level.Severe Illness: Individuals who have SpO2 <94% on room air at sea level", "student2": "a ratio of arterial partialpressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) <300 mm Hg, a respiratory rate >30breaths/min, or lung infiltrates >50%.Critical Illness: Individuals who have respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organdysfunction.Patients with certain underlying comorbidities are at a higher risk of progressing to severe COVID-19.These comorbidities include being aged \u226565 years; having cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease,sickle cell disease, diabetes, cancer, obesity, or chronic kidney disease; being pregnant; being a cigarettesmoker; being a transplant recipient; and receiving immunosuppressive therapy.1 Health care providersshould monitor such patients closely until clinical recovery is achieved.The optimal pulmonary imaging technique has not yet been defined for people with symptomaticSARS-CoV-2 infection. Initial evaluation for these patients may include a chest X-ray, ultrasoundscreening, or, if indicated, a computed tomography scan.", "student3": "An electrocardiogram should be performed ifindicated. Laboratory testing includes a complete blood count with differential and a metabolic profile,including liver and renal function tests. Although inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP),D-dimer, and ferritin are not routinely measured as part of standard care, results from such measurementsmay have prognostic value.2-4The definitions for the severity of illness categories listed above also apply to pregnant patients. However,the threshold for certain interventions may be different for pregnant patients and nonpregnant patients.For example, oxygen supplementation is recommended for pregnant patients when SpO2 falls below 95%on room air at sea level to accommodate physiologic changes in oxygen demand during pregnancy and toensure adequate oxygen delivery to the fetus.5 If laboratory parameters are used for monitoring pregnantpatients and making decisions about interventions, clinicians should be aware that normal physiologicchanges during pregnancy can alter several laboratory values. In general, leukocyte cell count increasesthroughout gestation and delivery and peaks during the immediate postpartum period. This increase ismainly due to neutrophilia.6 D-dimer and CRP levels also increase during pregnancy and are often higherin pregnant patients than nonpregnant patients.7 Detailed information on treating COVID-19 in pregnantpatients can be found in Special Considerations in Pregnancy and in the pregnancy considerationssubsection of each section of the Guidelines.Downloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 35In pediatric patients, radiographic abnormalities are common and, for the most part, should not bethe only criteria used to determine the severity of illness. The normal values for respiratory rate alsovary with age in children; therefore, hypoxemia should be the primary criterion used to define severeCOVID-19, especially in younger children.", "student4": "In a small number of children and in some young adults,SARS-CoV-2 infection may be followed by a severe inflammatory condition called multisysteminflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).8,9 This syndrome is discussed in detail in SpecialConsiderations in Children.Asymptomatic or Presymptomatic InfectionAsymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection can occur, although the percentage of patients who remain trulyasymptomatic throughout the course of infection is variable and incompletely defined. It is unclear whatpercentage of individuals who present with asymptomatic infection progress to clinical disease. Someasymptomatic individuals have been reported to have objective radiographic findings that are consistentwith COVID-19 pneumonia.10,11 Increasing the availability of virologic testing for SARS-CoV-2and reliable serologic assays for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies will help determine the true prevalence ofasymptomatic and presymptomatic infection. See Therapeutic Management of Nonhospitalized AdultsWith COVID-19 for recommendations regarding SARS-CoV-2-specific therapy.Mild IllnessPatients with mild illness may exhibit a variety of signs and symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat,malaise, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of taste and smell). They do not haveshortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, or abnormal imaging. Most mildly ill patients can be managedin an ambulatory setting or at home through telemedicine or telephone visits. No imaging or specificlaboratory evaluations are routinely indicated in otherwise healthy patients with mild COVID-19. Olderpatients and those with underlying comorbidities are at higher risk of disease progression; therefore,health care providers should monitor these patients closely until clinical recovery is achieved. SeeTherapeutic Management of Nonhospitalized Adults With COVID-19 for recommendations regardingSARS-CoV-2-specific therapy.Moderate IllnessModerate illness is defined as evidence of lower respiratory disease during clinical assessment orimaging, with SpO2 \u226594% on room air at sea level. Given that pulmonary disease can progress rapidlyin patients with COVID-19, patients with moderate disease should be closely monitored. If bacterialpneumonia or sepsis is suspected, administer empiric antibiotic treatment, re-evaluate the patientdaily, and de-escalate or stop antibiotics if there is no evidence of bacterial infection. See TherapeuticManagement of Nonhospitalized Adults With COVID-19 for recommendations regarding SARS-CoV-2-specific therapy.Severe IllnessPatients with COVID-19 are considered to have severe illness if they have SpO2 <94% on room airat sea level, PaO2/FiO2 <300 mm Hg, a respiratory rate >30 breaths/min, or lung infiltrates >50%.These patients may experience rapid clinical deterioration.", "student5": "Oxygen therapy should be administeredimmediately using a nasal cannula or a high-flow oxygen device.

In addition to pulmonary disease, patients with critical illnessmay also experience cardiac, hepatic, renal, central nervous system, or thrombotic disease.As with any patient in the intensive care unit (ICU), successful clinical management of a patient withCOVID-19 includes treating both the medical condition that initially resulted in ICU admission andother comorbidities and nosocomial complications.", "student6": "For more information, see Care of Critically Ill AdultPatients With COVID-19.Infectious Complications in Patients With COVID-19Some patients with COVID-19 may have additional infections that are noted when they present forcare or that develop during the course of treatment. These coinfections may complicate treatment andrecovery.", "student7": "Older patients or those with certain comorbidities or immunocompromising conditions may beat higher risk for these infections. The use of immunomodulators such as dexamethasone, interleukin-6inhibitors (e.g., tocilizumab, sarilumab), or Janus kinase inhibitors (e.g., baricitinib, tofacitinib) to treatCOVID-19 may also be a risk factor for infectious complications; however, when these therapies areused appropriately, the benefits outweigh the risks.Infectious complications in patients with COVID-19 can be categorized as follows:\u2022 Coinfections at Presentation With COVID-19: Although most individuals present with onlySARS-CoV-2 infection, concomitant viral infections, including influenza and other respiratoryviruses, have been reported.12 Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia has also been reported,but it is uncommon, with a prevalence that ranges from 0% to 6% of people with SARS-CoV-2infection.12,13 Antibacterial therapy is generally not recommended unless additional evidence forbacterial pneumonia is present (e.g., leukocytosis, the presence of a focal infiltrate on imaging).\u2022 Reactivation of Latent Infections: There are case reports of underlying chronic hepatitis Bvirus and latent tuberculosis infections reactivating in patients with COVID-19 who receiveimmunomodulators as treatment,14-16 although the data are currently limited. Reactivation of herpessimplex virus and varicella zoster virus infections have also been reported.17 Cases of severe anddisseminated strongyloidiasis have been reported in patients with COVID-19 during treatmentwith tocilizumab and corticosteroids.18,19 Many clinicians would initiate empiric treatment (e.g.,treatment with ivermectin) with or without serologic testing in patients who are from areas whereStrongyloides is endemic (i.e., tropical, subtropical, or warm temperate areas).20\u2022 Nosocomial Infections in Patients With COVID-19:", "student8": "Hospitalized patients with COVID-19may acquire common nosocomial infections, such as hospital-acquired pneumonia (includingventilator-associated pneumonia), line-related bacteremia or fungemia, catheter-associated urinarytract infection, and Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea. Early diagnosis and treatment ofthese infections are important for improving outcomes in these patients.\u2022 Opportunistic Fungal Infections:", "student9": "Invasive fungal infections, including aspergillosis andmucormycosis, have been reported in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.21-24 Althoughthese infections are relatively rare, they can be fatal, and they may be more commonly seen inimmunocompromised patients and in patients who are on mechanical ventilation. The majorityof mucormycosis cases have been reported in India and are associated with diabetes mellitus and/or the use of corticosteroids.25,26 The approach for managing these fungal infections should be thesame as the approach for managing invasive fungal infections in other settings.Downloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 37SARS-CoV-2 ReinfectionAs seen with other viral infections, reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 after recovery from prior infectionhas been reported.27 The true prevalence of reinfection is not known, although there are concerns thatthe frequency of reinfection may increase with the circulation of new variants.28 SARS-CoV-2 can oftenbe detected from a nasal swab for weeks to months after the initial infection; therefore, repeat testingto evaluate for reinfection should be considered only for those who have recovered from the initialinfection and present with COVID-19-compatible symptoms with no obvious alternate etiology (AIII).29Diagnostic testing in this setting is summarized in Testing for SARS-CoV-2 Infection.", "student10": "In addition,if reinfection is suspected, guidelines for the diagnosis and evaluation of suspected SARS-CoV-2reinfection are provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).30It has been speculated that reinfection may occur more frequently in those who have a less robustimmune response during the initial infection, as is often reported in those with mild illness. Reinfectionmay also occur as initial immune responses wane over time. Nevertheless, one review noted thatSARS-CoV-2 reinfection occurred after previous severe disease in three cases and as early as 3 weeksafter the initial infection was diagnosed.31 A public site that posts a variety of published and unpublishedreports of reinfection notes that reinfection has occurred anywhere from a few weeks to many monthsafter the initial infection, and it occasionally follows episodes of severe COVID-19.32 Although dataare limited, there is no evidence to suggest that the treatment of suspected or documented SARS-CoV-2reinfection should be different from the treatment used during the initial infection, as outlined inTherapeutic Management of Nonhospitalized Adults With COVID-19 and Therapeutic Management ofHospitalized Adults With COVID-19.Persistent Symptoms or Organ Dysfunction After Acute COVID-19There have been an increasing number of reports of patients who experience persistent symptoms and/ororgan dysfunction after acute COVID-19. Data about the incidence, natural history, and etiology of thesesymptoms are emerging. However, these reports have several limitations. For example, there is currentlyno agreed-upon case definition for persistent symptoms or organ dysfunction after acute COVID-19.", "student11": "Inaddition, most of these reports only included patients who attended post-COVID-19 clinics, and theyoften lack comparator groups. No specific treatments for the persistent effects of COVID-19 have yetbeen identified, although this COVID-19 rapid guideline proposes general management strategies.The nomenclature for this phenomenon is evolving, and there is no established clinical terminology todate. It has been referred to as post-COVID-19 condition, or, colloquially, \u201clong COVID,\u201d and affectedpatients have been referred to as \u201clong haulers.\u201d The term \u201cpost-acute sequelae of COVID-19\u201d (PASC)has also been used to describe late sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection that include these persistentsymptoms, as well as other delayed syndromes such as MIS-C and multisystem inflammatory syndromein adults (MIS-A). To date, no case definition and no specific time frame have been established to definethe syndrome of persistent symptoms and/or organ dysfunction after acute COVID-19. However, CDCrecently proposed defining late sequelae as sequelae that extend >4 weeks after initial infection.33,34 ThePatient-Led Research Collaborative for COVID-19 defines long COVID as a collection of symptomsthat develop during or following a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19 and that continue for >28days.35 Incidence rates vary widely, from about 10% in some reports to one cohort study in which 87%of patients reported at least one persistent symptom.36Some of the symptoms overlap with the post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) that has been describedin patients without COVID-19, but prolonged symptoms and disabilities after COVID-19 have alsobeen reported in patients with milder illness, including outpatients (see General Considerations forinformation on PICS).37,38Downloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 38Despite the limitations of the available descriptive data on these persistent symptoms, somerepresentative studies have suggested that common findings include fatigue, joint pain, chest pain,palpitations, shortness of breath, cognitive impairment, and worsened quality of life.39,40CDC conducted a telephone survey of a random sample of 292 adult outpatients who had positivepolymerase chain reaction results for SARS-CoV-2. Among the 274 respondents who were symptomaticat the time of testing, 35% reported not having returned to their usual state of health 2 weeks or moreafter testing; this included 26% of patients aged 18 to 34 years, 32% of those aged 35 to 49 years, and47% of those aged \u226550 years.38 An age of \u226550 years and the presence of three or more chronic medicalconditions were associated with not returning to usual health within 14 to 21 days. Moreover, one infive individuals aged 18 to 34 years who did not have chronic medical conditions had not returned tobaseline health when interviewed at a median of 16 days from the testing date.In a cohort study from Wuhan, China, 1,733 discharged patients with COVID-19 were evaluated forpersistent symptoms at a median of 186 days after symptom onset.", "student12": "The most common symptomswere fatigue or muscle weakness and sleep difficulties (reported among 63% and 26% of participants,respectively). Anxiety or depression was reported among 23% of patients.In a longitudinal prospective cohort of mostly outpatients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2infection at the University of Washington, 177 participants completed a follow-up questionnairebetween 3 and 9 months after illness onset.42 Overall, 91% of the respondents were outpatients (150with mild illness and 11 with no symptoms), and only 9% had moderate or severe disease that requiredhospitalization. Among those who reported symptoms, 33% of outpatients and 31% of hospitalizedpatients reported at least one persistent symptom. Persistent symptoms were reported by 27% of thepatients aged 18 to 39 years, 30% of those aged 40 to 64 years, and 43% of those aged \u226565 years. Themost common persistent symptoms were loss of sense of smell or taste and fatigue (both reported by14% of patients).Persistent symptoms after acute COVID-19 have also been reported in pregnant people.43 Systematicdata on persistent symptoms in children following recovery from the acute phase of COVID-19 arenot currently available, although case reports suggest that children may experience long-term effectssimilar to those experienced by adults after clinical COVID-19.44,45 MIS-C is discussed in SpecialConsiderations in Children.FatigueThe prevalence of fatigue among 128 individuals from Ireland who had recovered from the acute phaseof COVID-19 was examined using the Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFQ11). More than half of patients (67of 128 patients [52.3%]) reported persistent fatigue at a median of 10 weeks after initial symptoms firstappeared. There was no association between illness severity and fatigue.46 An outpatient service thatwas developed in Italy for patients recovering from acute COVID-19 reported that 87% of 143 patientssurveyed had persistent symptoms for a mean of 60 days after symptom onset.", "student13": "The most commonsymptom was fatigue, which occurred in 53.1% of these patients.36CardiopulmonaryA study from the United Kingdom reported that among 100 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (32received care in the ICU and 68 received care in hospital wards only), 72% of the ICU patients and 60%of the ward patients experienced fatigue and breathlessness at 4 to 8 weeks after hospital discharge.The authors suggested that posthospital rehabilitation may be necessary for some of these patients.39 Aretrospective study from China found that pulmonary function (as measured by spirometry) was stillimpaired 1 month after hospital discharge in 31 of 57 patients (54.4%) with COVID-19.47 In a studyDownloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 39from Germany that included 100 patients who had recently recovered from COVID-19, cardiac magneticresonance imaging (MRI) performed a median of 71 days after diagnosis revealed cardiac involvementin 78% of patients and ongoing myocardial inflammation in 60% of patients.48 A retrospective studyfrom China of 26 patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and who had initially presented withcardiac symptoms found abnormalities on cardiac MRI in 15 patients (58%).49 This assessment of theprevalence of cardiac abnormalities in people with PASC should be viewed with caution, however, asthe analysis included only patients with cardiac symptoms.NeuropsychiatricNeurologic and psychiatric symptoms have also been reported among patients who have recoveredfrom acute COVID-19. High rates of anxiety and depression have been reported in some patients usingself-report scales for psychiatric distress.40,50 Younger patients have been reported to experience morepsychiatric symptoms than patients aged >60 years.39,40 Patients may continue to experience headaches,vision changes, hearing loss, loss of taste or smell, impaired mobility, numbness in extremities, tremors,myalgia, memory loss, cognitive impairment, and mood changes for up to 3 months after diagnosis ofCOVID-19.51-53 One study in the United Kingdom administered cognitive tests to 84,285 participantswho had recovered from suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. These participants had worseperformances across multiple domains than would be expected for people with the same ages anddemographic profiles; this effect was observed even among those who had not been hospitalized.54However, the study authors did not report when the tests were administered in relation to the diagnosisof COVID-19.More research and more rigorous observational cohort studies are needed to better understand thepathophysiology and clinical course of post-acute COVID-19 sequelae and to identify managementstrategies for patients.

The clinicaltrials discussed below have not demonstrated a clinical benefit for protease inhibitors in patients withCOVID-19.RecommendationsThe COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) recommends against the use oflopinavir/ritonavir and other HIV protease inhibitors for the treatment of COVID-19 inhospitalized patients (AI).The Panel recommends against the use of lopinavir/ritonavir and other HIV proteaseinhibitors for the treatment of COVID-19 in nonhospitalized patients (AIII).RationaleThe pharmacodynamics of lopinavir/ritonavir raise concerns about whether it is possible to achieve drugconcentrations that can inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 proteases.2,3 In addition, lopinavir/ritonavir did notshow efficacy in two large randomized controlled trials in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.4,5There is currently a lack of data on the use of lopinavir/ritonavir in nonhospitalized patients withCOVID-19. However, the pharmacodynamic concerns and the lack of evidence for a clinical benefitamong hospitalized patients with COVID-19 undermine confidence that lopinavir/ritonavir has a clinicalbenefit at any stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Adverse EventsThe adverse events for lopinavir/ritonavir include:Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (common) QTc prolongation HepatotoxicityDrug-Drug InteractionsLopinavir/ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A. Coadministering lopinavir/ritonavirwith medications that are metabolized by this enzyme may increase the concentrations of thosemedications, resulting in concentration-related toxicities. Please refer to the Guidelines for the Use ofAntiretroviral Agents in Adults and Adolescents with HIV for a list of potential drug interactions.Summary of Clinical Data for COVID-19\u2022 The plasma drug concentrations achieved using typical doses of lopinavir/ritonavir are far belowthe levels that may be needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication.

The trial was conducted across 176 hospitals in the United Kingdom andenrolled hospitalized patients with clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.4Patients were randomized into several parallel treatment arms; this included randomization in a 2:1ratio to receive either the usual standard of care only or the usual standard of care plus lopinavir 400mg/ritonavir 100 mg orally every 12 hours for 10 days or until hospital discharge. Patients who hadsevere hepatic insufficiency or who were receiving medications that had potentially serious or lifethreatening interactions with lopinavir/ritonavir were excluded from randomization into either of thesearms.", "student15": "Mechanically ventilated patients were also underrepresented in this study because it was difficultto administer the oral tablet formulation of lopinavir/ritonavir to patients who were on mechanicalventilation. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at Day 28 after randomization.The lopinavir/ritonavir arm was discontinued on June 29, 2020, after the independent data monitoringcommittee concluded that the data showed no clinical benefit for lopinavir/ritonavir.Patient Characteristics\u2022 Of the 7,825 participants who were eligible to receive lopinavir/ritonavir, 1,616 were randomizedto receive lopinavir/ritonavir and 3,424 were randomized to receive standard of care only. Theremaining participants were randomized to other treatment arms in the study.\u2022 In both the lopinavir/ritonavir arm and the standard of care arm, the mean age was 66 years; 44%of patients were aged \u226570 years.Test results for SARS-CoV-2 infection were positive for 88% of patients. The remaining 12% hada negative test result.Comorbidities were common; 57% of patients had at least one major comorbidity. Of thosepatients, 28% had diabetes mellitus, 26% had heart disease, and 24% had chronic lung disease.At randomization, 4% of patients were receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, 70% werereceiving oxygen only (with or without noninvasive ventilation), and 26% were receiving neither.\u2022 The percentages of patients who received azithromycin or another macrolide during the follow-upDownloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 151period were similar in both arms (23% in the lopinavir/ritonavir arm vs. 25% in the standard ofcare arm).

Among the patients who were not on invasive mechanical ventilation atthe time of randomization, those who received lopinavir/ritonavir were as likely to require intubation ordie during hospitalization as those who received standard of care.Lopinavir/Ritonavir in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: The Solidarity TrialThe Solidarity trial was an open-label, randomized controlled trial that enrolled hospitalized patientswith COVID-19 in 405 hospitals across 30 countries. The study included multiple arms; in one arm,participants received lopinavir/ritonavir. The control group for this arm included people who wererandomized at the same site and time who could have received lopinavir/ritonavir but received standard ofcare instead. Lopinavir 400 mg/ritonavir 100 mg was administered orally twice daily for 14 days or untilhospital discharge. Only the oral tablet formulation of lopinavir/ritonavir was available, which precludedadministration to those on mechanical ventilation. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality.5After the results of the RECOVERY trial prompted a review of the Solidarity data, the lopinavir/ritonavir arm ended enrollment on July 4, 2020. At that time, 1,411 patients had been randomized toreceive lopinavir/ritonavir, and 1,380 patients received standard of care.Patient CharacteristicsIn both the lopinavir/ritonavir arm and the standard of care arm, 20% of the participants were aged\u226570 years and 37% were aged <50 years.Comorbidities were common. Diabetes mellitus was present in 24% of patients, heart disease in21%, and chronic lung disease in 7%.Downloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 152\u2022 At randomization, 8% of patients were receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporealmembrane oxygenation, 53% were receiving oxygen only (with or without noninvasiveventilation), and 39% were receiving neither.Similar percentages of patients received corticosteroids in the lopinavir/ritonavir arm and thestandard of care arm (23% vs. 24%). Other nonstudy treatments were administered less often, andthe use of these treatments was balanced between arms.ResultsThere was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality between the two arms; 148 patients(9.7%) in the lopinavir/ritonavir arm and 146 patients (10.3%) in the standard of care arm had diedby Day 28 (rate ratio 1.00; 95% CI, 0.79\u20131.25; P = 0.97).Progression to mechanical ventilation among those who were not ventilated at randomizationoccurred in 126 patients in the lopinavir/ritonavir arm and 121 patients in the standard of care arm.In-hospital mortality results appeared to be consistent across subgroups.LimitationsThe study was not blinded.Those who were on mechanical ventilation were unable to receive lopinavir/ritonavir.\u2022 The study includes no data on time to recovery.InterpretationAmong hospitalized patients, lopinavir/ritonavir did not decrease in-hospital mortality or the number ofpatients who progressed to mechanical ventilation compared to standard of care.Lopinavir/Ritonavir Pharmacokinetics in Patients With COVID-19In a case series, eight patients with COVID-19 were treated with lopinavir 400 mg/ritonavir 100mg orally twice daily and had plasma trough levels of lopinavir drawn and assayed by liquidchromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.3ResultsThe median plasma lopinavir concentration was 13.6 \u03bcg/mL.After correcting for protein binding, trough levels would need to be approximately 60-foldto 120-fold higher to achieve the in vitro half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) forSARS-CoV-2.Limitations\u2022 Only the trough levels of lopinavir were quantified.\u2022 The concentration of lopinavir required to effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in vivo iscurrently unknown.InterpretationThe plasma drug concentrations that were achieved using typical doses of lopinavir/ritonavir are farbelow the levels that may be needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication.Other Reviewed StudiesThe Panel has reviewed other clinical studies that evaluated the use of protease inhibitors for thetreatment of COVID-19.6,8,9 These studies have limitations that make them less definitive andDownloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 153informative than larger randomized clinical trials. The Panel\u2019s summaries and interpretations of some ofthese studies are available in the archived versions of the Guidelines.", "student17": "The SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes four major structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane(M), and nucleocapsid (N), as well as nonstructural and accessory proteins. The spike protein is furtherdivided into two subunits, S1 and S2, that mediate host cell attachment and invasion. Through itsreceptor-binding domain (RBD), S1 attaches to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the hostcell; this initiates a conformational change in S2 that results in virus-host cell membrane fusion andviral entry.1 Anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target the spike protein have beenshown to have a clinical benefit in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection (as discussed below). Some antiSARS-CoV-2 mAbs have been found to be effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection in householdcontacts of infected patients2 and during SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in skilled nursing and assisted livingfacilities.3Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Monoclonal Antibodies That Have Received Emergency UseAuthorizations From the Food and Drug AdministrationCurrently, three anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAb products have received Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs)from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 innonhospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who are at high risk forprogressing to severe disease and/or hospitalization. The issuance of an EUA does not constitute FDAapproval. These products are:\u2022 Bamlanivimab plus etesevimab: These are neutralizing mAbs that bind to different, butoverlapping, epitopes in the spike protein RBD of SARS-CoV-2.\u2022 The distribution of bamlanivimab plus etesevimab was paused in the United States becauseboth the Gamma (P.1) and Beta (B.1.351) variants have reduced susceptibility to bamlanivimaband etesevimab.4 However, distribution of the agents has been reinstated in states with low ratesof these and other variants that have reduced susceptibility to bamlanivimab and etesevimab.Please refer to the FDA webpage Bamlanivimab and Etesevimab Authorized States, Territories,and U.S. Jurisdictions for the latest information on bamlanivimab plus etesevimab distribution.\u2022 Casirivimab plus imdevimab: These are recombinant human mAbs that bind to nonoverlappingepitopes of the spike protein RBD of SARS-CoV-2.\u2022 Sotrovimab: This mAb was originally identified in 2003 from a SARS-CoV survivor. It targets anepitope in the RBD of the spike protein that is conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.The FDA has expanded the EUAs for bamlanivimab plus etesevimab and casirivimab plus imdevimabto authorize their use as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for certain individuals who are at high risk ofacquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection and, if infected, are at high risk of progressing to serious illness. SeePrevention of SARS-CoV-2 Infection and the FDA EUA fact sheets for bamlanivimab plus etesevimaband casirivimab plus imdevimab for more information.Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Monoclonal Antibodies for the Treatment of COVID-19The recommendations and discussion below pertain only to the use of the authorized anti-SARS-CoV-2mAb products for the treatment of COVID-19. For recommendations and discussion regarding the useof mAb products as PEP, see Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 Infection.Downloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 166Recommendations\u2022 The COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) recommends using one of the followinganti-SARS-CoV-2 mAb products (listed alphabetically and not in order of preference) to treatnonhospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of clinicalprogression (see the EUA criteria for use of the products and the related discussion below):\u2022 Bamlanivimab 700 mg plus etesevimab 1,400 mg administered as an intravenous (IV)infusion in regions where the combined frequency of potentially resistant SARS-CoV-2variants is low (see the FDA webpage Bamlanivimab and Etesevimab Authorized States,Territories, and U.S. Jurisdictions; or\u2022 Casirivimab 600 mg plus imdevimab 600 mg administered as an IV infusion or assubcutaneous (SQ) injections; or\u2022 Sotrovimab 500 mg administered as an IV infusion.\u2022 When using casirivimab plus imdevimab, the Panel recommends:\u2022 Casirivimab 600 mg plus imdevimab 600 mg administered as an IV infusion (AIIa)\u2022 If an IV infusion is not feasible or would cause a delay in treatment, casirivimab 600 mg plusimdevimab 600 mg can be administered as four SQ injections (2.5 mL per injection) (BIII).\u2022 When using anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs, treatment should be started as soon as possible after thepatient receives a positive result on a SARS-CoV-2 antigen test or nucleic acid amplification test(NAAT) and within 10 days of symptom onset.\u2022 The use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs should be considered for patients with mild to moderateCOVID-19 who are hospitalized for a reason other than COVID-19 if they otherwise meet theEUA criteria for outpatient treatment.\u2022 Anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs are not currently authorized for use in patients who are hospitalized withsevere COVID-19; however, they may be available through expanded access programs for patientswho either have not developed an antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection or are not expectedto mount an effective immune response to infection.\u2022 For guidance on prioritizing the use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs for the treatment or preventionof SARS-CoV-2 infection when logistical or supply constraints limit their availability, see ThePanel\u2019s Updated Statement on the Prioritization of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Monoclonal Antibodies.RationaleIn randomized, placebo-controlled trials in nonhospitalized patients who had mild to moderateCOVID-19 symptoms and certain risk factors for disease progression, the use of anti-SARS-CoV-2mAb products reduced the risk of hospitalization and death (see Table 3a).5-7 It is worth noting that thesestudies were conducted before the widespread circulation of variants of concern (VOC). The potentialimpact of these variants and their susceptibility to different anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs is discussed below.Bamlanivimab Plus EtesevimabThis anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAb combination has demonstrated a clinical benefit in people with mild tomoderate COVID-19 who are at high risk for progression to severe disease and/or hospitalization (seeTable 3a). The distribution of bamlanivimab plus etesevimab was paused in the United States becauseboth the Gamma (P.1) and Beta (B.1.351) variants have reduced susceptibility to bamlanivimab andetesevimab.4 However, distribution of the product has been reinstated across the United States becausethe combined frequency of the Gamma and Beta variants is <5%. Casirivimab plus imdevimab andsotrovimab are expected to remain active against the Gamma and Beta variants.", "student18": "Downloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 167The FDA provides a list of states, territories, and U.S. jurisdictions in which bamlanivimab plusetesevimab is currently authorized.", "student19": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID-19Data Tracker website has the latest information on variant frequencies by region in the United States.Casirivimab Plus ImdevimabOn June 3, 2021, the FDA updated the EUA for casirivimab plus imdevimab to reduce the authorizeddosage for a single IV infusion from casirivimab 1,200 mg plus imdevimab 1,200 mg to casirivimab600 mg plus imdevimab 600 mg.6 The update also authorized SQ injection of these lower doses ofcasirivimab and imdevimab if an IV infusion is not feasible or would delay treatment. SQ administrationrequires four injections (2.5 mL per injection) at four different sites (see the FDA EUA for details).The recommendation for using the lower dose of casirivimab 600 mg plus imdevimab 600 mg IV isbased on the Phase 3 results from the R10933-10987-COV-2067 study (ClinicalTrials.gov IdentifierNCT04425629). This double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial in outpatients with mild tomoderate COVID-19 evaluated different doses of casirivimab plus imdevimab. The modified fullanalysis set included participants aged \u226518 years who had a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chainreaction result at randomization and who had one or more risk factors for progression to severeCOVID-19. The results demonstrated a 2.2% absolute reduction and a 70% relative reduction inhospitalization or death with receipt of casirivimab 600 mg plus imdevimab 600 mg. These resultsare comparable to the those observed for IV infusions of casirivimab 1,200 mg plus imdevimab 1,200mg, which demonstrated a 3.3% absolute reduction and a 71% relative reduction in hospitalization ordeath among patients who received this higher dose of casirivimab plus imdevimab.8 See Table 3a foradditional details from the trial.The recommendation for using SQ injections to administer casirivimab plus imdevimab is basedon safety data from the Phase 1 R10933-10987-HV-2093 study (ClinicalTrials.gov IdentifierNCT04519437).", "student20": "This double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial compared casirivimabplus imdevimab administered by SQ injection to placebo in healthy volunteers who did not haveSARS-CoV-2 infection. Injection site reactions were observed in 12% of the 729 casirivimab plusimdevimab recipients and in 4% of the 240 placebo recipients. According to the FDA EUA, in aseparate trial that evaluated casirivimab plus imdevimab in symptomatic participants, there were similarreductions in viral load in the participants in the IV and SQ arms of the trial.6 However, because thesafety and efficacy data for casirivimab plus imdevimab administered by SQ injection are limited, thisroute of administration should only be used when IV infusion is not feasible or would lead to a delay intreatment (BIII).SotrovimabThe data that support the EUA for sotrovimab are from the Phase 3 COMET-ICE trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04545060). The COMET-ICE trial included outpatients with mild to moderateCOVID-19 who were at high risk for progression to severe disease and/or hospitalization. A total of583 participants were randomized to receive sotrovimab 500 mg IV (n = 291) or placebo (n = 292). Theprimary endpoint was the proportion of participants who were hospitalized for \u226524 hours or who diedfrom any cause by Day 29. Endpoint events occurred in 3 of 291 participants (1%) in the sotrovimabarm and 21 of 292 participants (7%) in the placebo arm (P = 0.002), resulting in a 6% absolute reductionand an 85% relative reduction in hospitalizations or death associated with sotrovimab.7Criteria for Using Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Monoclonal Antibodies Under the EmergencyUse AuthorizationsThe FDA EUAs for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs include a list of specific conditions that place patientsat high risk for clinical progression. On May 14, 2021, the FDA revised the EUAs to broaden theseDownloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 168criteria.5,6 Notable changes included lowering the body mass index (BMI) cutoff from \u226535 to >25 andadding other conditions and factors (e.g., pregnancy, race or ethnicity). Other than being aged \u226512 years,there are no longer any age criteria restricting the use of these agents in patients with the followingconditions: sickle cell disease, neurodevelopmental disorders, medical-related technological dependence,asthma, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and chronic lung disease.RecommendationsThe strength of the evidence for using anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs varies depending on the medicalconditions and other factors that place patients at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19 and/orhospitalization. The ratings for the recommendations for the use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs as treatmentare based on the FDA EUA criteria for the following.Medical Conditions or Other Factors That Were Represented in Patients in Clinical Trials ThatEvaluated Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Monoclonal Antibodies\u2022 Aged \u226565 years (AIIa)\u2022 Obesity (BMI >30) (AIIa)\u2022 Diabetes (AIIa)\u2022 Cardiovascular disease (including congenital heart disease) or hypertension (AIIa)\u2022 Chronic lung diseases (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, moderate-to-severe asthma,interstitial lung disease, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension) (AIIa)Other Conditions or Factors That Had Limited Representation in Patients in Clinical Trials but AreConsidered Risk Factors for Progression to Severe COVID-19 by the Centers for Disease Controland Prevention\u2022 An immunocompromising condition or immunosuppressive treatment (AIII).

For additional informationon medical conditions and other factors that are associated with increased risk for progression to severeCOVID-19, see the CDC webpage People With Certain Medical Conditions. The decision to use antiSARS-CoV-2 mAbs for a patient should be based on an individualized assessment of risks and benefits.7Some of the Panel\u2019s recommendations for using anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs according to the updated EUAcriteria are based on preliminary results from the clinical trials that have evaluated these products. TheDownloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 169details on the study designs, methods, and follow-up periods for these trials are currently limited. Whenpeer-reviewed data from the Phase 3 trials become publicly available, the Panel will review the resultsand update the recommendations for using anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs if necessary.Using Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Monoclonal Antibodies in Patients Hospitalized forCOVID-19The FDA EUAs do not authorize the use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs for the following patients:\u2022 Those hospitalized for COVID-19; or\u2022 Those who require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19; or\u2022 Those who are on chronic oxygen therapy due to an underlying non-COVID-19-relatedcomorbidity and who require an increase in oxygen flow rate from baseline because of COVID-19.The FDA EUAs do permit the use of these agents in patients who are hospitalized for a diagnosis otherthan COVID-19, provided they have mild to moderate COVID-19 and are at high risk for progressing tosevere disease.13-15Anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs have been evaluated in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. Asubstudy of the ACTIV-3 trial randomized patients who were hospitalized for COVID-19 to receivebamlanivimab 7,000 mg or placebo, each in addition to remdesivir. On October 26, 2020, studyenrollment was halted after a prespecified interim futility analysis indicated a lack of clinical benefit forbamlanivimab.16,17There are now data that support the use of casirivimab 4,000 mg plus imdevimab 4,000 mg inhospitalized patients with COVID-19 who are seronegative for the anti-spike protein antibody. In theRECOVERY study, hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were randomized to receive standard ofcare with casirivimab 4,000 mg plus imdevimab 4,000 mg IV or standard of care alone. There was nodifference in 28-day all-cause mortality between the casirivimab plus imdevimab arm and the standardof care arm; 944 of 4,839 patients (20%) in the casirivimab plus imdevimab arm died versus 1,026of 4,946 patients (21%) in the standard of care arm (rate ratio 0.94; 95% CI, 0.86\u20131.03; P = 0.17).However, in the subgroup of patients who were seronegative for the anti-spike protein antibody, therewas a significant reduction in 28-day all-cause mortality in the casirivimab plus imdevimab arm (396of 1,633 casirivimab plus imdevimab recipients [24%] died vs. 451 of 1,520 standard of care recipients[30%]; rate ratio 0.80; 95% CI, 0.70\u20130.91; P = 0.001).18 This higher dose of casirivimab plus imdevimabis not available through the current EUA, and currently, casirivimab plus imdevimab is only authorizedfor use in nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19. In addition, rapid serology testing that can identifyseronegative individuals in real time is currently not widely available.Anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs may be available through expanded access programs for the treatmentof immunocompromised patients who are hospitalized because of COVID-19. It is not yet knownwhether these mAb products provide clinical benefits in people with B-cell immunodeficiency or otherimmunodeficiencies.SARS-CoV-2 Variants and Their Susceptibility to Anti-SARS-CoV-2 MonoclonalAntibodiesIn laboratory studies, some SARS-CoV-2 variants that harbor certain mutations have markedly reducedsusceptibility to a number of the authorized anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs.19 The clinical relevance of reducedin vitro susceptibility of select variants to anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs is under investigation.Some of the key SARS-CoV-2 variants that have been identified are:Downloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 170\u2022 Alpha (B.1.1.7): This variant retains in vitro susceptibility to all the anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs thatare currently available through EUAs.5,6\u2022 Beta (B.1.351): This variant includes the E484K and K417N mutations, which results in markedlyreduced in vitro susceptibility to bamlanivimab and etesevimab.5 In vitro studies also suggestthat the Beta (B.1.351) variant has markedly reduced susceptibility to casirivimab, althoughthe combination of casirivimab and imdevimab appears to retain activity against the variant.Sotrovimab also appears to retain activity against the variant.6,7\u2022 Gamma (P.1): This variant includes the E484K and K417T mutations, which results in markedlyreduced in vitro susceptibility to bamlanivimab and etesevimab.5,20,21 The Gamma (P.1) variantalso has reduced susceptibility to casirivimab; however, the combination of casirivimab plusimdevimab appears to retain activity against the variant. Sotrovimab also appears to retain activityagainst the Gamma (P.1) variant.6,7\u2022 Delta (B.1.617.2, non-AY.1/AY.2): This is the predominant VOC circulating in the United States.This VOC retains in vitro susceptibility to all the anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs that are currentlyavailable through FDA EUAs.5", "student22": "Mesenchymal Stem CellsMesenchymal stem cells are investigational products that have been studied extensively for broadclinical applications in regenerative medicine1 and for their immunomodulatory properties.2 It ishypothesized that mesenchymal stem cells could reduce the acute lung injury and inhibit the cellmediated inflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2.RecommendationThe COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel recommends against the use of mesenchymal stemcells for the treatment of COVID-19, except in a clinical trial (AIIb).Rationale for RecommendationNo mesenchymal stem cells products are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for thetreatment of COVID-19. There are limited data to date to assess the role of mesenchymal stem cells forthe treatment of COVID-19.The FDA has recently issued several warnings about patients being vulnerable to stem cell treatmentsthat are illegal and potentially harmful.3 Several umbilical cord blood-derived products are currentlylicensed by the FDA for indications such as the treatment of cancer (e.g., stem cell transplant) or raregenetic diseases, and as scaffolding for cartilage defects and wound beds. None of these products areapproved for the treatment of COVID-19 or any other viral disease.4 In the United States, mesenchymalstem cells should not be used for the treatment of COVID-19 outside of an FDA-approved clinical trial,expanded access program, or an Emergency Investigational New Drug application (AII).Rationale for Use in COVID-19Mesenchymal stem cells are multipotent adult stem cells that are present in most human tissues, includingthe umbilical cord. Mesenchymal stem cells can self-renew by dividing and can differentiate into multipletypes of tissues (including osteoblasts, chondroblasts, adipocytes, hepatocytes, and others), which has ledto a robust clinical research agenda in regenerative medicine. It is hypothesized that mesenchymal stemcells could reduce the acute lung injury and inhibit the cell-mediated inflammatory response induced bySARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, because they lack the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor thatSARS-CoV-2 uses for viral entry into cells, mesenchymal stem cells are resistant to infection.5,6Clinical DataData supporting the use of mesenchymal stem cells in patients who have viral infections, includingSARS-CoV-2 infection, are limited to case reports and small, open-label studies.Clinical Data for COVID-19A pilot study of intravenous mesenchymal stem cell transplantation in China enrolled 10 patients withconfirmed COVID-19 categorized according to the National Health Commission of China criteria ascritical, severe, or common type. Seven patients (one with critical illness, four with severe illness, andtwo with common-type illness) received mesenchymal stem cells; three patients with severe illnessDownloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 201received placebo. All seven patients who received mesenchymal stem cells recovered. Among thethree severely ill placebo-treated patients, one died, one developed acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS), and one remained stable with severe disease.7A small clinical trial evaluated human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (hUC-MSC) infusion inpatients with severe COVID-19 who had not responded to standard of care therapies after 7 to 10 daysof treatment. The standard of care therapies included supplemental oxygen, umifenovir/oseltamivir,antibiotics if indicated, and glucocorticoids. The study was intended as a randomized controlled trial;however, due to the lack of sufficient hUC-MSCs, it was not possible to randomize the participants asoriginally planned. Among the 41 patients eligible to participate in the study, 12 received hUC-MSCinfusion and 29 received standard of care therapies only. The study arms were well balanced with regardto demographic characteristics, laboratory test results, and disease severity. All 12 participants whoreceived hUC-MSC infusion recovered without requiring mechanical ventilation and were discharged tohome. Four patients who received only standard of care therapies progressed to critical illness requiringmechanical ventilation; three of these patients died.", "student23": "These results are not statistically significant, andinterpretation of the findings is limited by the study\u2019s lack of randomization and small sample size.8A double-blind randomized controlled trial investigated the safety and efficacy of hUC-MSC infusionsin patients with COVID-19 ARDS. Twenty-four patients were randomized to receive either twoinfusions of hUC-MSC (prepared at a single site) or placebo on Day 0 and Day 3. The primary endpointswere occurrence of prespecified infusion-associated adverse events within 6 hours of each hUC-MSCinfusion; cardiac arrest or death within 24 hours after an infusion; and the incidence of adverse events.Secondary endpoints included survival at 31 days after hUC-MSC infusion and time to recovery.9There were no differences between the arms in the primary safety analysis; however, more deathsoccurred in the placebo arm (7 deaths) than in the hUC-MSC arm (2 deaths) by Day 31. Data forone participant in the hUC-MSC arm who died due to a failed intubation was censored from theanalysis. Time to recovery was shorter in the hUC-MSC arm than in the placebo arm (HR 0.29; 95%CI, 0.09\u20130.95). Interpretation of these results is limited by the small sample size and a change in aneligibility criterion from enrolling only individuals on invasive mechanical ventilation to including thosereceiving high-flow oxygen or on noninvasive ventilation.Clinical Data for Other Viral InfectionsIn an open-label study of mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment of H7N9 influenza in China, 17patients received mesenchymal stem cell treatment plus standard of care, and 44 patients receivedstandard of care only.", "student24": "Three patients (17.6%) in the mesenchymal stem cell arm died versus 24patients (54.5%) in the standard of care arm. The 5-year follow-up was limited to five patients in themesenchymal stem cell arm. No safety concerns were identified.10Clinical TrialsSee ClinicalTrials.gov for a list of clinical trials evaluating mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment ofCOVID-19, COVID-19-related ARDS, and COVID-19-associated multisystem inflammatory syndromein children (MIS-C).Adverse EffectsRisks associated with mesenchymal stem cell transfusion appear to be uncommon. The potential risksinclude the potential for mesenchymal stem cells to multiply or change into inappropriate cell types,product contamination, growth of tumors, infections, thrombus formation, and administration sitereactions.11Downloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 202Considerations in PregnancyThere are insufficient data to assess the risk of using mesenchymal stem cell therapy during pregnancy.Considerations in ChildrenThere are insufficient data to assess the efficacy and safety of using mesenchymal stem cell therapy inchildren.", "student25": "Patients with severe COVID-19 can develop a systemic inflammatory response that can lead to lunginjury and multisystem organ dysfunction. It has been proposed that the potent anti-inflammatory effectsof corticosteroids might prevent or mitigate these deleterious effects.Both beneficial and deleterious clinical outcomes have been reported with use of corticosteroids (mostlyprednisone or methylprednisolone) in patients with pulmonary infections. In patients with Pneumocystisjirovecii pneumonia and hypoxemia, prednisone therapy reduced the risk of death.1 However, duringoutbreaks of previous novel coronavirus infections (i.e., Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]and severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]), corticosteroid therapy was associated with delayedvirus clearance.2,3 In patients with severe pneumonia caused by influenza viruses, corticosteroid therapyappears to result in worse clinical outcomes, including secondary bacterial infections and death.4Corticosteroid therapy has also been studied in critically ill patients with acute respiratory distresssyndrome (ARDS) with conflicting results.5-7 Use of corticosteroids in patients with ARDS wasevaluated in seven randomized controlled trials that included a total of 851 patients.6-12 A meta-analysisof these trial results demonstrated that, compared with placebo, corticosteroid therapy reduced the riskof all-cause mortality (risk ratio 0.75; 95% CI, 0.59\u20130.95) and the duration of mechanical ventilation(mean difference -4.93 days; 95% CI, -7.81 to -2.06 days).13,14Corticosteroid use for the treatment of COVID-19 has been studied in clinical trials (see Tables 4a and4b for more information). The COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel\u2019s (the Panel) recommendationsfor the use of corticosteroids in patients with COVID-19 are based on the results from these studies.RecommendationsFor nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19:See Therapeutic Management of Nonhospitalized Adults with COVID-19 for the Panel\u2019srecommendations on the use of dexamethasone or other systemic corticosteroids in certainnonhospitalized patients.There is insufficient evidence for the Panel to recommend either for or against the use of inhaledbudesonide for the treatment of COVID-19.For hospitalized patients with COVID-19:See Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized Adults with COVID-19 for the Panel\u2019srecommendations on the use of dexamethasone or other systemic corticosteroids in certainhospitalized patients.RationaleThe Panel\u2019s recommendations on the use of corticosteroids for COVID-19 in nonhospitalized patientsreflect a lack of data regarding their use in this population.", "student26": "In the RECOVERY trial (described below),dexamethasone was shown to reduce mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who requiredsupplemental oxygen; however, treatment with dexamethasone was stopped at the time of hospitaldischarge. Because nonhospitalized patients were not included in the RECOVERY trial, the safety andefficacy of corticosteroid use for COVID-19 in this population have not been established. Moreover,the use of corticosteroids can lead to adverse events (e.g., hyperglycemia, neuropsychiatric symptoms,Downloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 209secondary infections), which may be difficult to detect and monitor in an outpatient setting (seeTherapeutic Management of Nonhospitalized Adults With COVID-19).The Panel\u2019s recommendations on the use of corticosteroids for COVID-19 in hospitalized patientsare largely based on data from the RECOVERY trial. This large, multicenter, open-label randomizedcontrolled trial performed in the United Kingdom randomized 6,425 hospitalized patients to receive upto 10 days of dexamethasone plus the standard of care or the standard of care only. Mortality at Day 28was lower among the patients who received dexamethasone than among those who received the standardof care alone.15 This mortality benefit was observed in patients who were mechanically ventilated orrequired supplemental oxygen at enrollment. No benefit of dexamethasone was seen in patients whodid not require supplemental oxygen at enrollment. Details of the RECOVERY trial are summarized inTable 4d.15Systemic corticosteroids used in combination with other agents including antivirals andimmunomodulators, such as tocilizumab (see Interleukin-6 Inhibitors)16,17 or baricitinib (see KinaseInhibitors),18 have demonstrated clinical benefit in subsets of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.Various formulations of systemic corticosteroids used in different doses for varying durations havebeen studied in patients with COVID-19 in several smaller randomized controlled trials.19-23 Some ofthese trials were stopped early due to under-enrollment following the release of the results from theRECOVERY trial. Consequently, the sample size of many these trials was insufficient to assess efficacy,and therefore evidence to support the use of methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone for the treatment ofCOVID-19 is not as strong as that demonstrated for dexamethasone in the RECOVERY trial.Please see Tables 4a and 4b for data from clinical trials that have evaluated corticosteroid use for thetreatment of COVID-19.Systemic Corticosteroids Other Than DexamethasoneIf dexamethasone is not available, alternative glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone,methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone) can be used.For these drugs, the total daily dose equivalencies to dexamethasone 6 mg (oral or intravenous[IV])24 are:Prednisone 40 mgMethylprednisolone 32 mgHydrocortisone 160 mgHalf-life, duration of action, and frequency of administration vary among corticosteroids.Long-acting corticosteroid: Dexamethasone; half-life 36 to 72 hours, administer once daily.Intermediate-acting corticosteroids: Prednisone and methylprednisolone; half-life 12 to 36hours, administer once daily or in two divided doses daily.Short-acting corticosteroid: Hydrocortisone; half-life 8 to 12 hours, administer in two to fourdivided doses daily.Hydrocortisone is commonly used to manage septic shock in patients with COVID-19; seeHemodynamics for more information. Unlike other corticosteroids previously studied in patientswith ARDS, dexamethasone lacks mineralocorticoid activity and thus has minimal effect onsodium balance and fluid volume.9Downloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 210Inhaled CorticosteroidsBudesonide is a synthetic, inhaled corticosteroid with potent glucocorticoid activity and weakmineralocorticoid activity. It has broad anti-inflammatory properties and has Food and DrugAdministration-labeled indications for the management of chronic respiratory diseases including asthmaand chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Certain inhaled corticosteroids have been shown to impairviral replication of SARS-CoV-225 and downregulate expression of the receptors used for cell entry.26,27These mechanisms support the potential of inhaled corticosteroids as therapeutic agents for COVID-19.However, observational studies have found that long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids prescribed fornon-COVID-19 respiratory diseases either had no effect on COVID-19 outcomes or increased the riskof hospitalization.28,29 More recently, two open-label randomized controlled trials provided additionalinsights regarding the role of inhaled budesonide in outpatients with COVID-19, as described below andin Table 4b.RecommendationThere is insufficient evidence for the Panel to recommend either for or against the use of inhaledbudesonide for the treatment of COVID-19.RationaleInhaled budesonide was studied in two open-label randomized controlled trials in outpatients withmild symptoms of COVID-19.30,31 The small STOIC trial suggested that in adult outpatients withmild COVID-19, initiation of inhaled budesonide may reduce the need for urgent care or emergencydepartment assessment or hospitalization.30 PRINCIPLE, a larger open-label trial in nonhospitalizedpatients with COVID-19 at high risk of disease progression, found that inhaled budesonide did notaffect the rate of hospitalization or death but did reduce time to self-reported recovery.31 The findingsfrom these trials should be interpreted with caution given the open-label design of the studies and otherlimitations as outlined in the study description in Table 4b. Additional trials of inhaled corticosteroidsare ongoing.Most of the patients included in the PRINCIPLE trial would also have been candidates for anti-SARSCoV-2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy, which has been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalizationand death in patients who have mild to moderate COVID-19 and certain risk factors for diseaseprogression. Whether inhaled budesonide provides any additional benefit for patients who have receivedanti-SARS-CoV-2 mAb therapy is unknown.Monitoring, Adverse Effects, and Drug-Drug Interactions for SystemicCorticosteroidsClinicians should closely monitor patients with COVID-19 who are receiving dexamethasone foradverse effects (e.g., hyperglycemia, secondary infections, psychiatric effects, avascular necrosis).The use of systemic corticosteroids may increase the risk of opportunistic fungal infections(e.g., mucormycosis, aspergillosis) and reactivation of latent infections (e.g., hepatitis B virus,herpesvirus infections, strongyloidiasis, tuberculosis).32-36\u2022 Cases of severe and disseminated strongyloidiasis have been reported in patients with COVID-19during treatment with tocilizumab and corticosteroids.37,38 Many clinicians would initiate empirictreatment for strongyloidiasis (e.g., with ivermectin) with or without serologic testing in patientsfrom areas where Stronglyloides is endemic (i.e., tropical, subtropical, or warm temperate areas).39Combining systemic corticosteroids with other immunosuppressants, such as tocilizumab orbaricitinib, could theoretically increase the risk of secondary infections. However, this adverseDownloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 211effect has not been reported in clinical trials to date.Dexamethasone is a moderate cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inducer. As such, it may reduce theconcentration and potential efficacy of concomitant medications that are CYP3A4 substrates.Clinicians should review a patient\u2019s medication regimen to assess potential interactions.", "student27": "Dexamethasone should be continued for up to 10 days or until hospital discharge, whichevercomes first (see Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized Adults With COVID-19).Considerations in PregnancyA short course of betamethasone or dexamethasone, which are known to cross the placenta, is routinelyused to decrease neonatal complications of prematurity in women with threatened preterm delivery.40,41Given the potential benefit of decreased maternal mortality and the low risk of fetal adverse effects fora short course of dexamethasone therapy, the Panel recommends using dexamethasone for hospitalizedpregnant patients with COVID-19 who are mechanically ventilated (AIII) or who require supplementaloxygen but who are not mechanically ventilated (BIII).Considerations in ChildrenThe safety and effectiveness of dexamethasone or other corticosteroids for COVID-19 treatmenthave not been sufficiently evaluated in pediatric patients and caution is warranted when extrapolatingrecommendations for adults to patients aged <18 years. The Panel recommends using dexamethasonefor children with COVID-19 who require high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, invasivemechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (BIII). Corticosteroids are notroutinely recommended for pediatric patients who require only low levels of oxygen support (i.e.,administered via a nasal cannula only). Use of dexamethasone for the treatment of severe COVID-19in children who are profoundly immunocompromised has not been evaluated and may be harmful;therefore, such use should be considered only on a case-by-case basis. The dexamethasone dosingregimen for pediatric patients is dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg/dose (maximum dose 6 mg) once dailyfor up to 10 days. Corticosteroid use has been described in the treatment of multisystem inflammatorysyndrome in children (MIS-C) in multiple case series. It is the second most used therapy after IVimmunoglobulin for MIS-C.42,43 Please refer to Special Considerations in Children for more informationon the management of MIS-C.Clinical TrialsSeveral clinical trials evaluating corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19 are currently underwayor in development.

However, due to the study\u2019s reliance onparticipant self-reports and missing data, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the efficacyof fluvoxamine for the treatment of COVID-19.3Prospective Observational Study During an Outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 InfectionsA prospective, nonrandomized observational cohort study evaluated fluvoxamine for the treatment ofCOVID-19 in 113 outpatients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antigen with the result confirmedby a PCR test. The trial was conducted in an occupational setting during an outbreak of COVID-19.Patients were offered the option of receiving fluvoxamine 50 mg twice daily for 14 days or no therapy.4Patient Characteristics\u2022 Of the 113 participants with positive SARS-CoV-2 antigen, 65 opted to take fluvoxamine and 48did not.\u2022 More of the patients who did not take fluvoxamine had hypertension. In addition, more of thosewho were Latinx and more of those who were initially symptomatic opted to take fluvoxamine.Results\u2022 At Day 14, none of the patients who received fluvoxamine versus 60% of those who did not hadpersistent symptoms (e.g., anxiety, difficulty concentrating, fatigue) (P < 0.001).\u2022 By Day 14, none of the fluvoxamine-treated patients were hospitalized; six patients who did notreceive fluvoxamine were hospitalized, including two patients who required care in the intensivecare unit.\u2022 No serious adverse events were reported following receipt of fluvoxamine.Limitations\u2022 The study was a nonrandomized trial.\u2022 The study had a small sample size.\u2022 Limited data were collected during the study.Limitations (e.g., small sample size) and differences in study populations and fluvoxamine doses make itdifficult to interpret and generalize the findings of these trials.Additional studies, including a Phase 3 randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov IdentifierNCT04668950), are ongoing to provide more specific evidence-based guidance on the role offluvoxamine for the treatment of COVID-19.Adverse Effects, Monitoring, and Drug-Drug InteractionsWhen fluvoxamine is used to treat psychiatric conditions, the most common adverse effect is nausea, butadverse effects can include other gastrointestinal effects (e.g., diarrhea, indigestion), neurologic effects(e.g., asthenia, insomnia, somnolence), dermatologic reactions (sweating), and rarely suicidal ideation.Fluvoxamine is a cytochrome P450 (CYP) D6 substrate and a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2 and 2C19 anda moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9, 2D6, and 3A4.5 Fluvoxamine may enhance the anticoagulant effectsof antiplatelets and anticoagulants.

Fluvoxamine should notbe used within 2 weeks of receipt of other SSRIs or MAOIs and should be used with caution with otherQT-interval prolonging medications.Considerations in PregnancyFluvoxamine is not thought to increase the risk of congenital abnormalities; however, the data on itsuse in pregnancy are limited.6,7 A small, increased risk of primary persistent pulmonary hypertensionin the newborn associated with SSRI use in the late third trimester has not been excluded, although theabsolute risk is likely low.8 The risk of fluvoxamine use in pregnancy for the treatment of COVID-19should be balanced with the potential benefit.Considerations in ChildrenFluvoxamine is approved by the FDA for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder in childrenaged \u22658 years.9 Adverse effects due to SSRI use seen in children are similar to those seen in adults,although children and adolescents appear to have higher rates of behavioral activation and vomiting thanadults.10", "student31": "There are no data on the use of fluvoxamine for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 inchildren. Interferons (Alfa, Beta)Interferons are a family of cytokines with antiviral properties. They have been suggested as a potentialtreatment for COVID-19 because of their in vitro and in vivo antiviral properties.RecommendationThe COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel recommends against the use of interferons for thetreatment of patients with severe or critical COVID-19, except in a clinical trial (AIII). There isinsufficient evidence to recommend either for or against the use of interferon beta for the treatment ofearly (i.e., <7 days from symptom onset) mild and moderate COVID-19.RationaleStudies have shown no benefit of interferons in patients with other coronavirus infections (i.e., MiddleEast respiratory syndrome [MERS], severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]) who have severe orcritical disease. In addition, interferons have significant toxicities that outweigh the potential for benefit.Interferons may have antiviral activity early in the course of infection. However, there is insufficientdata to assess the potential benefit of interferon use during early disease versus the toxicity risks.Clinical Data for COVID-19Interferon Beta-1aPress release, July 20, 2020: A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in the United Kingdomevaluated inhaled interferon beta-1a (once daily for up to 14 days) in nonventilated patients hospitalizedwith COVID-19. Compared to the patients receiving placebo (n = 50), the patients receiving inhaledinterferon beta-1a (n = 48) were more likely to recover to ambulation without restrictions (HR 2.19;95% CI, 1.03\u20134.69; P = 0.04), had decreased odds of developing severe disease (OR 0.21; 95% CI,0.04\u20130.97; P = 0.046), and had less breathlessness. Additional detail is required to fully evaluatethese findings and their implications. Of note, inhaled interferon beta-1a as used in this study is notcommercially available in the United States.1Preprint manuscript posted online, July 13, 2020: An open-label, randomized trial at a single center inIran evaluated subcutaneous interferon beta-1a (three times weekly for 2 weeks) in patients with severeCOVID-19. There was no difference in the primary outcome of time to clinical response between theinterferon beta-1a group (n = 42) and the control group (n = 39), and there was no difference betweenthe groups in overall length of hospital stay, length of intensive care unit stay, or duration of mechanicalventilation.", "student32": "The reported 28-day overall mortality was lower in the interferon beta-1a group; however,four patients in the interferon beta-1a group who died before receiving the fourth dose of interferonbeta-1a were excluded from the analysis, which makes it difficult to interpret these results.2Combination of Interferon Beta-1b, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, and Ribavirin in the Treatment ofHospitalized Patients With COVID-19An open-label, Phase 2 clinical trial randomized 127 participants (median age of 52 years) 2:1 tocombination antiviral therapy or lopinavir/ritonavir. In the combination antiviral therapy group, thetreatment regimen differed by time from symptom onset to hospital admission. Participants hospitalizedwithin 7 days of symptom onset (n = 76) were randomized to triple drug therapy (interferon beta-1b 8million units administered subcutaneously every other day for up to 7 days total, lopinavir/ritonavir,and ribavirin); those hospitalized \u22657 days after symptom onset (n = 51) were randomized to doubleDownloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 241therapy (lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin) because of concerns regarding potential inflammatory effectsof interferon. Patients in the control group received lopinavir/ritonavir alone regardless of the time fromsymptom onset to hospitalization. The study participants were patients in Hong Kong with confirmedsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection who were hospitalized,regardless of disease severity, until they had two negative nasopharyngeal (NP) swab tests.The time to a negative result on a polymerase chain reaction SARS-CoV-2 test on an NP swab (theprimary endpoint) was shorter in the combination therapy group than in the control group (median of 7days vs. 12 days; P = 0.001). The combination group had more rapid clinical improvement as assessedby the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) 2 and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scoreand a shorter hospital stay (median of 9 days for the combination group vs. 14.5 days for the controlgroup; P = 0.016). There was no difference in oxygen use between the groups. The antiviral and clinicaleffect was more pronounced in the patients hospitalized within 7 days of symptom onset, suggestingthat interferon beta-1b with or without ribavirin was the critical component of the combination antiviraltherapy.", "student33": "The study provides no information about the effect of interferon beta-1b when administered \u22657days after symptom onset.3Interferon Alfa-2bIn a retrospective cohort study of 77 adults with moderate COVID-19 in China, participants weretreated with nebulized interferon alfa-2b, nebulized interferon alfa-2b with umifenovir, or umifenovironly. The time to viral clearance in the upper respiratory tract and reduction in systemic inflammationwas faster in the interferon alfa-2b groups than in the umifenovir only group. However, the resultsof this study are difficult to interpret because participants in the interferon alfa-2b with umifenovirgroup were substantially younger than those in the umifenovir only group (mean age of 40 years inthe interferon alfa-2b with umifenovir group vs. 65 years in the umifenovir only group) and had fewercomorbidities (15% in the interferon alfa-2b with umifenovir group vs. 54% in the umifenovir onlygroup) at study entry. The nebulized interferon alfa-2b formulation is not approved by the Food andDrug Administration for use in the United States.4Clinical Data for SARS and MERSInterferon beta used alone and in combination with ribavirin in patients with SARS and MERS hasfailed to show a significant positive effect on clinical outcomes.5-9In a retrospective observational analysis of 350 critically ill patients with MERS6 from 14 hospitalsin Saudi Arabia, the mortality rate was higher among patients who received ribavirin and interferon(beta-1a, alfa-2a, or alfa-2b) than among those who did not receive either drug.A randomized clinical trial that included 301 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome10 foundthat intravenous interferon beta-1a had no benefit over placebo as measured by ventilator-free days overa 28-day period (median of 10.0 days in the interferon beta-1a group vs. 8.5 days in the placebo group)or mortality (26.4% in the interferon beta-1a group vs. 23.0% in the placebo group).", "student34": "Clinical TrialsSee ClinicalTrials.gov for a list of ongoing clinical trials for interferon and COVID-19.Adverse EffectsThe most frequent adverse effects of interferon alfa include flu-like symptoms, nausea, fatigue, weightloss, hematological toxicities, elevated transaminases, and psychiatric problems (e.g., depression andsuicidal ideation). Interferon beta is better tolerated than interferon alfa.11,12Downloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 242Drug-Drug InteractionsThe most serious drug-drug interactions with interferons are the potential for added toxicity withconcomitant use of other immunomodulators and chemotherapeutic agents.11,12Considerations in PregnancyAnalysis of data from several large pregnancy registries did not demonstrate an association betweenexposure to interferon beta-1b preconception or during pregnancy and an increased risk of adverse birthoutcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, congenital anomaly),13,14 and exposure did not influence birthweight, height, or head circumference.15Considerations in ChildrenThere are limited data on the use of interferons for the treatment of respiratory viral infections in children.", "student35": "Endogenous interleukin (IL)-1 is elevated in patients with COVID-19.1,2 In addition, SARS-CoV-2infection causes epithelial damage that leads to the release of IL-1 beta, which recruits inflammatorycells and induces the release of IL-1 beta in monocytes. This in turn leads to the release of more IL-1 torecruit and activate additional innate immune cells. Drugs that block the IL-1 receptor (e.g., anakinra) ordrugs that block IL-1 signaling (e.g., canakinumab) can potentially interrupt this autoinflammatory loop.These drugs are being investigated as potential treatments for COVID-19.Anakinra is a recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist. It is approved by the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) to treat rheumatoid arthritis and cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes,specifically neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease.3 It is used off-label to treat severechimeric antigen receptor T cell-mediated cytokine release syndrome and macrophage activationsyndrome (MAS)/secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.Canakinumab is a human monoclonal antibody that targets the beta subunit of IL-1 and is approved bythe FDA for the treatment of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis and Still\u2019s disease.RecommendationsThere is insufficient evidence for the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) torecommend either for or against the use of anakinra for the treatment of COVID-19.", "student36": "The Panel recommends against the use of canakinumab for the treatment of COVID-19, exceptin a clinical trial (BIIa).RationaleIn the SAVE-MORE trial, 594 hospitalized patients who had moderate or severe COVID-19 pneumoniaand plasma-soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) levels \u22656 ng/mL were randomizedto receive either anakinra or placebo. The study found that patients who received anakinra had a lowerrisk of clinical progression of COVID-19 than those who received placebo.4 CORIMUNO-ANA-1, arandomized controlled trial that compared the use of anakinra to usual care in 116 hospitalized patientswho were hypoxemic but did not require high-flow oxygen or ventilation, was stopped early for futility.5REMAP-CAP, an open-label, adaptive platform, randomized controlled trial that evaluated severalimmunomodulators in patients with COVID-19 who required organ support, found that anakinra was noteffective in reducing the combined endpoint of in-hospital mortality and days of organ support.6 Althoughthe SAVE-MORE study suggests that suPAR levels could be used in risk stratification to identifypopulations that could benefit from IL-1 inhibition, the laboratory assay that is used to assess suPAR levelsis not currently available in many countries, including the United States. After reviewing the results of thestudies discussed above and taking into consideration the fact that suPAR assays are not widely availableto guide the use of anakinra, the Panel has concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommendeither for or against the use of anakinra for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients.Finally, CAN-COVID, a randomized controlled trial that evaluated canakinumab in hospitalized patientswith COVID-19 who were hypoxemic but did not require ventilatory support, reported that the useof canakinumab did not improve the likelihood of survival without invasive mechanical ventilation.7Because of these results, the Panel recommends against the use of canakinumab for the treatment ofCOVID-19, except in a clinical trial (BIIa).Downloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 245Clinical Data for COVID-19SAVE-MORESAVE-MORE was a randomized controlled trial in 594 hospitalized patients with moderate or severeCOVID-19 pneumonia and plasma suPAR levels \u22656 ng/mL.

Participants are eligible forenrollment if they are within 24 hours of receiving respiratory or cardiovascular organ support in theICU and they have suspected or microbiologically confirmed COVID-19.Anakinra 300 mg was given intravenously (IV) as a loading dose, followed by anakinra 100 mg IV every6 hours for 14 days until patients were either free from invasive mechanical ventilation for >24 hoursor discharged from the ICU. The primary outcome was measured using an ordinal scale that includeda composite of in-hospital mortality and duration of respiratory and cardiovascular organ support at 21days; all deaths up to 90 days were assigned the worst outcome.

Therefore, these studies did not substantially influence the Panel\u2019s currentrecommendations for using IL-1 inhibitors.", "student39": "Clinical TrialsSee ClinicalTrials.gov for a list of clinical trials that are evaluating anakinra and canakinumab for thetreatment of COVID-19.Adverse EffectsHeadache, nausea, vomiting, and liver enzyme elevations can occur with both anakinra andcanakinumab.Anakinra was not associated with any significant safety concerns when used in clinical trials for thetreatment of sepsis.12-14 Increased rates of infection were reported with prolonged anakinra use incombination with tumor necrosis factor-alpha blockade, but not with short-term use.15Considerations in PregnancyThe data on using IL-1 inhibitors to treat COVID-19 in pregnant patients are currently limited. TheAmerican College of Rheumatology recommends against the use of anakinra during pregnancy.16Unintentional first-trimester exposure to anakinra is unlikely to be harmful, given the minimal transferof monoclonal antibodies across the placenta early in pregnancy.17Downloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 248Considerations in ChildrenAnakinra has been used in the treatment of severely ill children with rheumatologic conditions,including MAS. The data on the use of anakinra in pediatric patients with acute respiratory distresssyndrome or sepsis are limited. Anakinra is rarely used to treat pediatric patients with acute COVID-19,and it has been used in approximately 10% of cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children(MIS-C).18,19 Anakinra is often included in institutional protocols for the treatment of MIS-C in theUnited States, and it is mentioned as an option for second-line therapy for refractory MIS-C in nationalconsensus guidelines.20-22 However, robust data on the effectiveness of anakinra for the treatment ofMIS-C are not currently available. Data on using canakinumab in pediatric patients are limited to use inpatients with periodic fever syndromes and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. There are no data onits use in pediatric patients with acute COVID-19 or MIS-C. The Panel recommends consulting with amultidisciplinary team when using immunomodulating therapy (which may include anakinra) in childrenwith MIS-C (AIII)", "student40": "Interleukin (IL)-6 is a pleiotropic, proinflammatory cytokine produced by a variety of cell types,including lymphocytes, monocytes, and fibroblasts. Infection by SARS-CoV induces a dose-dependentproduction of IL-6 from bronchial epithelial cells.1 COVID-19-associated systemic inflammation andhypoxemic respiratory failure can be associated with heightened cytokine release, as indicated byelevated blood levels of IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and ferritin.2-4 It is hypothesized thatmodulating IL-6 levels or the effects of IL-6 may reduce the duration and/or severity of COVID-19.There are two classes of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved IL-6 inhibitors: anti-IL-6receptor monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (e.g., sarilumab, tocilizumab) and anti-IL-6 mAbs (i.e.,siltuximab). These drugs have been evaluated in patients with COVID-19 who have systemicinflammation.Recommendations\u2022 See Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized Adults With COVID-19 for the COVID-19Treatment Guidelines Panel\u2019s (the Panel) recommendations on the use of IL-6 inhibitors (e.g.,sarilumab, tocilizumab) in hospitalized patients who require supplemental oxygen, high-flowoxygen, noninvasive ventilation, or invasive mechanical ventilation.\u2022 The Panel recommends against the use of anti-IL-6 mAb therapy (i.e., siltuximab) for thetreatment of COVID-19, except in a clinical trial (BI).Additional Considerations\u2022 Tocilizumab and sarilumab should be used with caution in groups of patients with COVID-19that have not been adequately studied in clinical trials. This includes patients who aresignificantly immunosuppressed, particularly those who have recently received other biologicimmunomodulating drugs, and those with:\u2022 Alanine transaminase levels >5 times the upper limit of normal\u2022 A high risk for gastrointestinal perforation\u2022 An uncontrolled serious bacterial, fungal, or non-SARS-CoV-2 viral infection\u2022 Absolute neutrophil counts <500 cells/\u00b5L\u2022 Platelet counts <50,000 cells/\u00b5L\u2022 Known hypersensitivity to the drug\u2022 Tocilizumab and sarilumab should only be given in combination with a course of dexamethasone(or an alternative corticosteroid at a dose that is equivalent to dexamethasone 6 mg). See theCorticosteroids section for more information.\u2022 Some clinicians may decide to assess the patient\u2019s clinical response to dexamethasone beforedeciding whether tocilizumab or sarilumab is needed.\u2022 In both the REMAP-CAP trial and the RECOVERY trial, 29% of patients received a seconddose of tocilizumab at the discretion of the treating physicians. However, the available data arecurrently insufficient to recommend either for or against a second dose.5,6\u2022 Cases of severe and disseminated strongyloidiasis have been reported in patients with COVID-19during treatment with tocilizumab and corticosteroids.7,8 Many clinicians would initiate empirictreatment (e.g., with ivermectin) with or without serologic testing in patients who are from areasDownloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 251where Strongyloides is endemic (i.e., tropical, subtropical, or warm temperate areas).9RationaleThe results of the RECOVERY and REMAP-CAP trials provide consistent evidence that tocilizumab,when administered with corticosteroids, offers a modest mortality benefit in certain patients withCOVID-19 who are severely ill, who are rapidly deteriorating and have increasing oxygen needs, andwho have a significant inflammatory response.5,6 However, the Panel found it challenging to define thespecific patient populations that would benefit from this intervention.", "student41": "If tocilizumab is not available,sarilumab may be used as an alternative because it has demonstrated a similar clinical benefit inimproving survival and reducing the duration of organ support in the REMAP-CAP trial.10 However,the Panel recommends sarilumab only when tocilizumab is not available or is not feasible to use (BIIa)because the evidence for the efficacy of tocilizumab is more extensive than that for sarilumab; in addition,sarilumab is currently only approved for use as a subcutaneous (SQ) injection in the United States.The data on the efficacy of siltuximab in patients with COVID-19 are currently limited.", "student42": "11Anti-Interleukin-6 Receptor Monoclonal AntibodiesTocilizumabTocilizumab is a recombinant humanized anti-IL-6 receptor mAb that is approved by the FDA for usein patients with rheumatologic disorders and cytokine release syndrome induced by chimeric antigenreceptor T cell (CAR T-cell) therapy. Tocilizumab can be dosed as an intravenous (IV) infusion or a SQinjection. The IV formulation should be used to treat cytokine release syndrome.11Clinical Data for COVID-19Clinical data on the use of tocilizumab (and other IL-6 inhibitors) for the treatment of COVID-19,including data from several randomized trials and large observational studies, are summarized in Table4d.The initial studies that evaluated the use of tocilizumab for the treatment of COVID-19 producedconflicting results. Many of these trials were limited by low power, heterogenous populations, and/or alow frequency of concomitant use of corticosteroids (now the standard of care for patients with severeCOVID-19).12-14 For example, trials that reported a treatment benefit of tocilizumab enrolled patientswho were receiving higher levels of oxygen support (e.g., high-flow nasal cannula oxygen, noninvasiveventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation) and/or included more patients who used corticosteroids.15,16Subsequently, the REMAP-CAP and RECOVERY trials\u2014the two largest randomized controlledtocilizumab trials\u2014both reported a mortality benefit of tocilizumab in certain patients, including patientsexhibiting rapid respiratory decompensation associated with an inflammatory response. REMAP-CAPenrolled a narrowly defined population of critically ill patients who were enrolled within 24 hours ofstarting respiratory support in an intensive care unit and who were randomized to receive open-labeltocilizumab or usual care.5 The RECOVERY trial enrolled hospitalized patients with COVID-19 into anopen-label platform trial that included several treatment options;6 a subset of all trial participants whoalso had hypoxemia and CRP levels \u226575 mg/L were offered enrollment into a second randomization thatevaluated tocilizumab versus usual care. Additional findings from the REMAP-CAP and RECOVERYtrials and the rationale for using tocilizumab in certain hospitalized patients who are exhibitingrapid respiratory decompensations due to COVID-19 can be found in Therapeutic Management ofHospitalized Adults With COVID-19.The Panel\u2019s recommendations for using tocilizumab are based on the collective evidence from theclinical trials reported to date (see Table 4d).Downloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 252Clinical TrialsSee ClinicalTrials.gov for a list of clinical trials that are evaluating the use of tocilizumab for thetreatment of COVID-19.Adverse EffectsThe primary laboratory abnormalities reported with tocilizumab treatment are elevated liver enzymelevels that appear to be dose dependent. Neutropenia or thrombocytopenia are uncommon. Inrandomized trials, no excess secondary infections were seen among patients who received combinationtherapy compared to study controls. Additional adverse effects, such as serious infections (e.g.,tuberculosis [TB], bacterial or fungal infections) and bowel perforation, have been reported.17Considerations in PregnancyThere are insufficient data to determine whether there is a tocilizumab-associated risk for major birthdefects or miscarriage. mAbs are actively transported across the placenta as pregnancy progresses(with the greatest transfer occurring during the third trimester), and this may affect immune responsesin utero in the exposed fetus. Given the paucity of data, current recommendations advise against theuse of tocilizumab during pregnancy.18 The decision to use tocilizumab during pregnancy should bea collaborative effort between pregnant individuals and their health care providers, and the decisionmaking process should include a discussion of the potential risks and benefits.Considerations in ChildrenThere are no systematic observational or randomized controlled trial data available on the effectivenessof tocilizumab for the treatment of COVID-19 or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children(MIS-C).", "student43": "Tocilizumab has been used for children with cytokine release syndrome associated with CART-cell therapy and systemic and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis.19 There is insufficient evidencefor the Panel to recommend either for or against the use of tocilizumab in hospitalized children withCOVID-19 or MIS-C.Drug AvailabilityOn June 24, 2021, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the use of tocilizumabin combination with corticosteroids in hospitalized adults and children aged \u22652 years with COVID-19who require supplemental oxygen, noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporealmembrane oxygenation.20 Per this EUA, if a patient\u2019s clinical signs or symptoms worsen or do notimprove after the first dose of tocilizumab, one additional infusion of tocilizumab may be administeredat least 8 hours after the initial IV infusion. If there is a local or regional shortage of tocilizumab,sarilumab can be used as an alternative (see Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized Adults WithCOVID-19).10SarilumabSarilumab is a recombinant humanized anti-IL-6 receptor mAb that is approved by the FDA for usein patients with rheumatoid arthritis. It is available as an SQ formulation and is not approved for thetreatment of cytokine release syndrome.Clinical Data for COVID-19The clinical data on the use of sarilumab as a treatment for COVID-19 are summarized in Table 4d.An adaptive Phase 2 and 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized (2:2:1) trial compared theefficacy and safety of sarilumab 400 mg IV and sarilumab 200 mg IV to placebo in hospitalized patientswith COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04315298). Results from this trial did not support aclinical benefit of sarilumab in hospitalized patients receiving supplemental oxygen.21Downloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 253A similar adaptive design study that was conducted in the United States in patients with severe andcritical COVID-19 also failed to show a benefit of sarilumab. In this trial, there was a numericaldecrease in mortality among participants with critical COVID-19 pneumonia who required mechanicalventilation and who received corticosteroids; however, because of the small sample size in this study, theresult was not statistically significant.22 In the REMAP-CAP trial, the efficacy results for sarilumab weresimilar to those for tocilizumab. Compared to the patients in the standard of care arm (n = 418), thosewho were randomized to receive sarilumab (n = 485) had more organ support-free days (OR 1.50; 95%CrI, 1.13\u20132.00) and better survival rates while hospitalized (OR 1.51; 95% CrI, 1.06\u20132.20). A notablelimitation to the sarilumab findings in the REMAP-CAP trial is that patients in the standard of care armwere enrolled earlier in the pandemic than patients who received sarilumab (i.e., randomization for thestandard of care arm closed on November 19, 2020, and randomization for the sarilumab arm continuedthrough April 10, 2021).10Clinical TrialsSee ClinicalTrials.gov for a list of clinical trials that are evaluating the use of sarilumab for the treatmentof COVID-19.Adverse Effects", "student44": "The primary laboratory abnormalities that have been reported with sarilumab treatment are transientand/or reversible elevations in liver enzyme levels that appear to be dose dependent and rare occurrencesof neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Additional adverse effects, such as serious infections (e.g., TB,bacterial or fungal infections) and bowel perforation, have been reported, but only with long-term use ofsarilumab.Considerations in PregnancyThere are insufficient data to determine whether there is a sarilumab-associated risk for major birthdefects or miscarriage. mAbs are actively transported across the placenta as pregnancy progresses (withthe greatest transfer occurring during the third trimester), and this may affect immune responses in uteroin the exposed fetus.Considerations in ChildrenThere are no data on the use of sarilumab in children other than data from ongoing trials that areassessing the drug\u2019s safety in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

These kinase inhibitors are proposed as treatments for COVID-19 because they can preventphosphorylation of key proteins involved in the signal transduction that leads to immune activation andinflammation (e.g., the cellular response to proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin [IL]-6).3Immunosuppression induced by JAK inhibitors could potentially reduce the inflammation and associatedimmunopathologies observed in patients with COVID-19. Additionally, JAK inhibitors, particularlybaricitinib, have theoretical direct antiviral activity through interference with viral endocytosis,potentially preventing SARS-CoV-2 from entering and infecting susceptible cells.4Recommendations\u2022 See Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized Adults with COVID-19 for the COVID-19Treatment Guidelines Panel\u2019s (the Panel) recommendations on the use of baricitinib and tofacitinibfor hospitalized patients who require high-flow oxygen or noninvasive ventilation.\u2022 The Panel recommends against the use of JAK inhibitors other than baricitinib or tofacitinibfor the treatment of COVID-19, except in a clinical trial (AIII).RationaleThe Panel\u2019s recommendations are based on data from the ACTT-2,5 COV-BARRIER,6 andSTOP-COVID7 clinical trials. The ACTT-2 trial demonstrated that baricitinib improved time to recoverywhen given in combination with remdesivir to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who requiresupplemental oxygen but not invasive mechanical ventilation.", "student46": "However, a key limitation of the ACTT-2trial is that corticosteroids were not used as standard of care; thus, it was not possible to evaluate theeffect of baricitinib when given in addition to corticosteroids.The COV-BARRIER trial enrolled patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and at least one elevatedinflammatory marker at enrollment who were not on invasive mechanical ventilation. This trial reportedan additional survival benefit of baricitinib when added to the standard of care of corticosteroids (withor without remdesivir). If baricitinib is not available, tofacitinib may be an alternative because it hasdemonstrated clinical benefit in the STOP-COVID trial.The clinical trial data on the use of baricitinib and tofacitinib in patients with COVID-19 is summarizedbelow, and all related treatment recommendations are reviewed in Therapeutic Management ofHospitalized Adults With COVID-19.Monitoring, Adverse Effects, and Drug-Drug InteractionsMost of the data on adverse effects of JAK inhibitors were reported based on chronic use of the agentsfor the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Adverse effects include infections (typically respiratoryand urinary tract infections) and the reactivation of herpes viruses, myelosuppression, transaminaseelevations, and, rarely, gastrointestinal perforation. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewof a large, randomized safety clinical trial comparing tofacitinib to anti-tumor necrosis factor inhibitorsin people with rheumatoid arthritis found that tofacitinib was associated with additional serious adverseDownloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 263events, including heart attack or stroke, cancer, blood clots, and death.8 The FDA is therefore requiringnew and updated warnings for drugs in the JAK inhibitor class, including tofacitinib and baricitinib.Data from randomized trials evaluating the safety of short-term use of JAK inhibitors in patientswith COVID-19 are limited. The data to date have not revealed significant safety signals, includingthrombosis; however, these trials may be underpowered for detecting rare adverse events.5-7A complete blood count with differential, liver function tests, and kidney function tests should beobtained in all patients before baricitinib is administered and during treatment as clinically indicated.Screening for viral hepatitis and tuberculosis should be considered. Considering its immunosuppressiveeffects, all patients receiving baricitinib should also be monitored for new infections.Tofacitinib is a cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 3A4 substrate. Dose modifications are required when the drugis administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or when used with a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor that iscoadministered with a strong CYP2C19 inhibitor. Coadministration with a strong CYP3A4 inducer isnot recommended.The ACTT-2 and COV-BARRIER trials evaluated oral baricitinib 4 mg once daily, which is twice thestandard baricitinib 2 mg once daily dose for FDA-approved indications.5,6 In patients with severehepatic impairment, baricitinib should only be used if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk.9Baricitinib has not been evaluated in clinical studies for FDA-approved indications in patients with anestimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) \u226430 mL/min. When baricitinib is used for the treatment ofCOVID-19 in adults with renal insufficiency, the Panel recommends reducing the dose of baricitinibfrom 4 mg to 2 mg daily for adults with an eGFR \u226530 to <60 mL/min and to 1 mg daily for those withan eGFR of 15 to <30 mL/min. Baricitinib is not recommended for patients with an eGFR <15 mL/min.9 There are limited clinical data on the use of baricitinib in combination with strong organic aniontransporter 3 inhibitors, and, in general, coadministration is not advised.10,11Considerations in PregnancyThere is a paucity of data on the use of JAK inhibitors in pregnancy. As small molecule-drugs, JAKinhibitors are likely to pass through the placenta, and therefore fetal risk cannot be ruled out.12 Decisionsregarding the administration of JAK inhibitors must include shared decision-making between thepregnant individual and their health care provider, considering potential maternal benefit and fetalrisks. Factors that may weigh into the decision-making process include maternal COVID-19 severity,comorbidities, and gestational age. Pregnancy registries provide some outcome data on tofacitinib useduring pregnancy for other conditions (e.g., ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis). Among the33 cases reported, pregnancy outcomes were similar to those among the general population.13-15Considerations in ChildrenAn FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) has been issued for the use of baricitinib in hospitalizedadults and children aged \u22652 years with COVID-19 who require supplemental oxygen, invasivemechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).9 The safety and efficacy ofbaricitinib have not been evaluated in pediatric patients with COVID-19. As noted above, tofacitinibwas shown to decrease the risk of respiratory failure and death in adults with COVID-19 in theSTOP-COVID trial.7 Tofacitinib is FDA approved for a pediatric indication; however, the safety andefficacy of tofacitinib have not been evaluated in pediatric patients with COVID-19.", "student47": "Thus, there isinsufficient evidence to recommend either for or against the use of baricitinib in combination withcorticosteroids and/or remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized children.BaricitinibBaricitinib is an oral JAK inhibitor that is selective for JAK1 and JAK2 and is FDA approved for theDownloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 264treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.10 Baricitinib can modulate downstream inflammatory responsesvia JAK1/JAK2 inhibition and has exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of IL-6-induced STAT3phosphorylation.16 Baricitinib has postulated antiviral effects by blocking SARS-CoV-2 from enteringand infecting lung cells.17 Baricitinib reduced inflammation and lung pathology in macaques infectedwith SARS-CoV-2, but an antiviral effect was not confirmed.18Clinical Data for COVID-19In the ACTT-2 trial, 1,033 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were randomized 1:1 to receivebaricitinib 4 mg daily for 14 days (or until hospital discharge) or placebo, both given in combinationwith remdesivir. The primary endpoint was time to recovery as measured on an eight-category ordinalscale. Recovery time was shorter in the baricitinib arm (7 days) than in the placebo arm (8 days) (rateratio for recovery 1.16; 95% CI, 1.01\u20131.32; P = 0.03). Mortality by 28 days was lower in the baricitinibarm than in the placebo arm, but the difference was not statistically significant. A key limitation ofthe study is that corticosteroids were not used as background standard care for patients with severe orcritical COVID-19 pneumonia.5In the COV-BARRIER trial, 1,525 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and an elevationin one or more inflammatory markers were randomized 1:1 to receive baricitinib 4 mg orally orplacebo for up to 14 days (or until hospital discharge). Patients on invasive mechanical ventilationwere excluded from study enrollment. Overall, 79% of patients received corticosteroids and 19%received remdesivir. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who progressed to high-flowoxygen, noninvasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death by Day 28.

All-cause mortality within 28 days, which was akey secondary endpoint, was 8.1% in the baricitinib arm and 13.1% in the placebo arm, resulting in a38.2% reduction in mortality associated with baricitinib (HR 0.57; 95% CI, 0.41\u20130.78). The mortalitydifference was most pronounced in the subgroup of patients receiving high-flow oxygen or noninvasiveventilation at baseline (17.5% for baricitinib recipients vs. 29.4% for placebo recipients; HR 0.52; 95%CI, 0.33\u20130.80).", "student48": "The occurrence of adverse events, serious adverse events, serious infections, and venousthromboembolic events was comparable in the baricitinib and placebo arms.6Additional findings from the ACTT-2 and COV-BARRIER trials and the rationale for using baricitinib incertain hospitalized patients with COVID-19 can be found in Therapeutic Management of HospitalizedAdults With COVID-19.Clinical TrialsPlease see ClinicalTrials.gov for the latest information on studies of baricitinib for the treatment ofCOVID-19.Drug AvailabilityBaricitinib is approved by the FDA for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

The background standard of care included corticosteroids (79.2% of patientswere receiving corticosteroids at randomization and overall, 89.3% received corticosteroids during thestudy) but not remdesivir. The primary outcome of death or respiratory failure through Day 28 occurredin 18.1% of patients in the tofacitinib arm and 29.0% in the placebo arm (risk ratio 0.63; 95% CI,0.41\u20130.97). All-cause mortality within 28 days was 2.8% in the tofacitinib arm and 5.5% in the placeboarm (risk ratio 0.49; 95% CI, 0.15\u20131.63).

A meta-analysis of studies in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 found an overallVTE prevalence of 14.1% (95% CI, 11.6\u201316.9).5 The VTE prevalence was higher in studies that usedultrasound screening (40.3%; 95% CI, 27.0\u201354.3) than in studies that did not (9.5%; 95% CI, 7.5\u201311.7).In randomized controlled trials conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the incidence of VTEin non-COVID-19 hospitalized patients who received VTE prophylaxis ranged from 0.3% to 1% forsymptomatic VTE and from 2.8% to 5.6% for VTE overall.6-8 The VTE incidence in randomized trialsin critically ill non-COVID-19 patients who received prophylactic dose anticoagulants ranged from 5%to 16%, and a prospective cohort study of critically ill patients with sepsis reported a VTE incidenceof 37%.9-12 VTE guidelines for non-COVID-19 patients have recommended against routine screeningultrasounds in critically ill patients because no study has shown that this strategy reduces the rate ofsubsequent symptomatic thromboembolic complications.13", "student53": "Although the incidence of thromboembolicevents, especially pulmonary emboli, can be high among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, thereare no published data demonstrating the clinical utility of routine surveillance for deep vein thrombosisusing lower extremity ultrasound in this population.A meta-analysis performed by an American Society of Hematology guidelines panel compared theodds of bleeding and thrombotic outcomes in patients with COVID-19 treated with prophylactic doseanticoagulation versus in those treated with intermediate or therapeutic dose anticoagulation.14 Overall,the odds of VTE and mortality were not different between the patients treated with prophylacticdose anticoagulation and those treated with higher doses of anticoagulation. In critically ill patients,intermediate or therapeutic dose anticoagulation was associated with a lower odds of pulmonaryembolism (OR 0.09; 95% CI, 0.02\u20130.57) but a higher odds of major bleeding (OR 3.84; 95% CI, 1.44\u201310.21).

The study further reported that in a subset of 395 mechanically ventilatedpatients, 29.1% of the patients who received anticoagulation and 62.7% of those who did not receiveanticoagulation died. The study had important limitations: it lacked details on patient characteristics,indications for anticoagulant initiation, and descriptions of other therapies that the patients receivedthat may have influenced mortality. In addition, the authors did not discuss the potential impact ofsurvival bias on the study results. For these reasons, the data are not sufficient to influence standardof care, and this study further emphasizes the need for prospective trials to define the risks andpotential benefits of therapeutic anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19.18 Three internationaltrials (Antithrombotic Therapy to Ameliorate Complications of COVID-19 [ATTACC], TherapeuticAnticoagulation; Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines-4 [ACTIV-4], and theRandomized, Embedded, Multi-factorial Adaptive Platform Trial for Community-Acquired Pneumonia[REMAP-CAP]) compared the effectiveness of therapeutic dose anticoagulation and prophylacticdose anticoagulation in reducing the need for organ support over 21 days in moderately ill or criticallyill adults hospitalized for COVID-19.

Only the patients treated with therapeutic anticoagulation showed improvementin the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2).The number of ventilator-free days was higher in the therapeutic anticoagulation arm than in theprophylactic anticoagulation arm (15 days [IQR 6\u201316] vs. 0 days [IQR 0\u201311]; P = 0.028). There wasno difference between the arms in in-hospital or 28-day mortality. Two patients treated with therapeuticanticoagulation had minor bleeding, and two patients in each arm experienced thrombosis.20 Additionalevidence from large, multicenter trials is needed, and the trial results are expected soon.Several randomized controlled trials have been developed to evaluate the risks and benefits ofanticoagulation in patients with COVID-19 (visit ClinicalTrials.gov for the current list of trials).Guidelines about coagulopathy and prevention and management of VTE in patients with COVID-19have been released by multiple organizations, including the Anticoagulation Forum,21 the AmericanCollege of Chest Physicians,22 the American Society of Hematology,23 the International Society ofThrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH),24 the Italian Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis,25 and theRoyal College of Physicians.26 In addition, a paper that outlines issues related to thrombotic disease withimplications for prevention and therapy has been endorsed by the ISTH, the North American ThrombosisForum, the European Society of Vascular Medicine, and the International Union of Angiology.27All of the guidelines referenced above agree that hospitalized patients with COVID-19 should receiveprophylactic dose anticoagulation for VTE. Some guidelines note that intermediate dose anticoagulationcan be considered for critically ill patients.21,23,26,28 Given the variation in VTE incidence and theunknown risk of bleeding in critically ill patients with COVID-19, the COVID-19 Treatment GuidelinesPanel and guideline panels of the American Society of Hematology and the American College of ChestPhysician recommend treating all hospitalized patients with COVID-19, including critically ill patients,with prophylactic dose anticoagulation.22,29 Results from clinical trials that assess the safety and efficacyDownloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 287of different anticoagulant doses will provide further information on the best prophylactic strategies forpatients with COVID-19.Monitoring Coagulation Markers in Patients With COVID-19In nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19, markers of coagulopathy, such as D-dimer level,prothrombin time, fibrinogen level, and platelet count, should not routinely be obtained (AIII). Althoughabnormalities in these coagulation markers have been associated with worse outcomes, prospective datademonstrating that the markers can be used to predict the risk of VTE in those who are asymptomatic orwho have mild SARS-CoV-2 infection is lacking.In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, hematologic and coagulation parameters are commonlymeasured; however, there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend either for or against usingsuch data to guide management decisions.Managing Antithrombotic Therapy in Patients With COVID-19Selection of Anticoagulant or Antiplatelet Drugs for Patients With COVID-19Whenever anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy is used, potential drug-drug interactions with otherconcomitant drugs must be considered (AIII). The University of Liverpool has collated a list of druginteractions. In hospitalized, critically ill patients, low molecular weight heparin or unfractionatedheparin is preferred over oral anticoagulants because the two types of heparin have shorter half-lives,can be administered intravenously or subcutaneously, and have fewer drug-drug interactions (AIII).Chronic Anticoagulant or Antiplatelet TherapyCOVID-19 outpatients receiving warfarin who are in isolation and thus unable to have internationalnormalized ratio monitoring may be candidates for switching to direct oral anticoagulant therapy.Patients receiving warfarin who have a mechanical heart valve, ventricular assist device, valvular atrialfibrillation, or antiphospholipid antibody syndrome or who are lactating should continue treatment withwarfarin (AIII). Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who are taking anticoagulant or antiplatelettherapy for underlying medical conditions should continue this treatment unless significant bleedingdevelops, or other contraindications are present (AIII).Patients with COVID-19 Who Are Managed as OutpatientsFor nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19, anticoagulants and antiplatelet therapy should not beinitiated for the prevention of VTE or arterial thrombosis unless the patient has other indications for thetherapy or is participating in a clinical trial (AIII).Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19For hospitalized patients with COVID-19, prophylactic dose anticoagulation should be prescribed unlesscontraindicated (e.g., a patient has active hemorrhage or severe thrombocytopenia) (AIII). Althoughdata supporting this recommendation are limited, a retrospective study showed reduced mortality inpatients who received prophylactic anticoagulation, particularly if the patient had a sepsis-inducedcoagulopathy score \u22654.4 For those without COVID-19, anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy should notbe used to prevent arterial thrombosis outside of the standard of care (AIII).

Participation in clinical trials is encouraged.Special Considerations During Pregnancy and LactationBecause pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state, the risk of thromboembolism is greater in pregnantindividuals than in nonpregnant individuals.34 It is not yet known whether COVID-19 increases thisrisk. In several cohort studies of pregnant women with COVID-19 in the United States and Europe,Downloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 289VTE was not reported as a complication even among women with severe disease, although the receiptof prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation varied across the studies.35-37 The American Collegeof Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) advises that, although there are no data for or againstthromboprophylaxis in the setting of COVID-19 in pregnancy, VTE prophylaxis can reasonably beconsidered for pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19, particularly for those who have severedisease.38 If there are no contraindications to use, the Society of Maternal Fetal Medicine recommendsprophylactic heparin or low molecular weight heparin in critically ill or mechanically ventilatedpregnant patients.39 Several professional societies, including the American Society of Hematologyand ACOG, have guidelines that specifically address the management of VTE in the context ofpregnancy.40,41 If delivery is threatened, or if there are other risks for bleeding, the risk of bleeding mayoutweigh the potential benefit of VTE prophylaxis in pregnancy.There are no data on the use of scoring systems to predict VTE risk in pregnant individuals.", "student56": "Additionally, during pregnancy, the D-dimer level may not be a reliable predictor of VTE because thereis a physiologic increase of D-dimer levels throughout gestation.42-44In general, the preferred anticoagulants during pregnancy are heparin compounds. Because of itsreliability and ease of administration, low-molecular weight heparin is recommended, rather thanunfractionated heparin, for the prevention and treatment of VTE in pregnancy.41Direct-acting anticoagulants are not routinely used during pregnancy due to the lack of safety datain pregnant individuals.40 The use of warfarin to prevent or treat VTE should be avoided in pregnantindividuals, regardless of their COVID-19 status, and especially during the first trimester due to theconcern for teratogenicity.Specific recommendations for pregnant or lactating individuals with COVID-19 include:\u2022 If antithrombotic therapy is prescribed during pregnancy prior to a diagnosis of COVID-19, thistherapy should be continued (AIII).\u2022 For pregnant patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19, prophylactic dose anticoagulation isrecommended unless contraindicated (BIII).\u2022 Like for nonpregnant patients, VTE prophylaxis after hospital discharge is not recommended forpregnant patients (AIII).

It is an antioxidant and free radical scavenger that has antiinflammatory properties, influences cellular immunity and vascular integrity, and serves as a cofactor inthe generation of endogenous catecholamines.1,2 Because humans may require more vitamin C in statesof oxidative stress, vitamin C supplementation has been evaluated in numerous disease states, includingserious infections and sepsis. Because SARS-CoV-2 infection may cause sepsis and acute respiratorydistress syndrome (ARDS), the potential role of high doses of vitamin C in ameliorating inflammationand vascular injury in patients with COVID-19 is being studied.Recommendation for Non-Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19", "student58": "There is insufficient evidence for the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) torecommend either for or against the use of vitamin C for the treatment of COVID-19 in noncritically ill patients.RationaleBecause patients who are not critically ill with COVID-19 are less likely to experience oxidative stressor severe inflammation, the role of vitamin C in this setting is unknown.Clinical Data on Vitamin C in Outpatients With COVID-19Oral Ascorbic Acid Versus Zinc Gluconate Versus Both Agents Versus Standard of CareIn an open-label clinical trial that was conducted at two sites in the United States, outpatients withlaboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were randomized to receive either 10 days of oral ascorbicacid 8,000 mg, zinc gluconate 50 mg, both agents, or standard of care.3 The primary end point was thenumber of days required to reach a 50% reduction in the patient\u2019s symptom severity score.

Nonserious adverse effects occurred more frequently in patients whoreceived supplements than in those who did not; 39.5% of patients in the ascorbic acid arm, 18.5% inthe zinc gluconate arm, and 32.1% in the arm that received both agents experienced nonserious adverseeffects compared with 0% of patients in the standard of care arm (overall P < 0.001). The most commonnonserious adverse effects in this study were gastrointestinal events.The limitations of this study include the small sample size and the lack of a placebo control. Inoutpatients with COVID-19, treatment with high-dose zinc gluconate, ascorbic acid, or a combination ofthe two supplements did not significantly decrease the number of days required to reach a 50% reductionin a symptom severity score compared with standard of care.Recommendation for Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19\u2022 There is insufficient evidence for the Panel to recommend either for or against the use of vitaminC for the treatment of COVID-19 in critically ill patients.Downloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 295RationaleThere are no controlled trials that have definitively demonstrated a clinical benefit for vitamin C in criticallyill patients with COVID-19, and the available observational data are inconclusive. Studies of vitamin Cregimens in sepsis patients and ARDS patients have reported variable efficacy and few safety concerns.Clinical Data on Vitamin C in Critically Ill PatientsIntravenous Vitamin C Alone in Patients With COVID-19A pilot clinical trial in China randomized 56 adults with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit to receiveintravenous (IV) vitamin C 24 g per day or placebo for 7 days. The study was terminated early due to areduction in the number of cases of COVID-19 in China. Overall, the study found no differences betweenthe arms in mortality, the duration of mechanical ventilation, or the change in median sequential organfailure assessment (SOFA) scores. The study reported improvements in oxygenation (as measured by theratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen [PaO2/FiO2]) from baseline toDay 7 in the treatment arm that were statistically greater than those observed in the placebo arm (+20.0 vs.-51.9; P = 0.04).4Intravenous Vitamin C Alone in Patients Without COVID-19A small, three-arm pilot study compared two regimens of IV vitamin C to placebo in 24 critically illpatients with sepsis. Over the 4-day study period, patients who received vitamin C 200 mg/kg perday and those who received vitamin C 50 mg/kg per day had lower SOFA scores and lower levels ofproinflammatory markers than patients who received placebo.5In a randomized controlled trial in critically ill patients with sepsis-induced ARDS (n = 167), patients whoreceived IV vitamin C 200 mg/kg per day for 4 days had SOFA scores and levels of inflammatory markersthat were similar to those observed in patients who received placebo. However, 28-day mortality waslower in the treatment group (29.8% vs. 46.3%; P = 0.03), coinciding with more days alive and free of thehospital and the intensive care unit.6 A post hoc analysis of the study data reported a difference in medianSOFA scores between the treatment group and placebo group at 96 hours; however, this difference was notpresent at baseline or 48 hours.7Intravenous Vitamin C Plus Thiamine With or Without Hydrocortisone in Critically Ill PatientsWithout COVID-19Two small studies that used historic controls reported favorable clinical outcomes (i.e., reduced mortality,reduced risk of progression to organ failure, and improved radiographic findings) in patients withsepsis or severe pneumonia who received a combination of vitamin C, thiamine, and hydrocortisone.8,9Subsequently, several randomized trials in which patients received vitamin C and thiamine (with or withouthydrocortisone) to treat sepsis and septic shock showed that this combination conferred benefits for certainclinical parameters. However, no survival benefit was reported. Two trials observed reductions in organdysfunction (as measured by change in SOFA score on Day 3)10,11 or the duration of shock12 without aneffect on clinical outcomes. Three other trials, including a large trial of 501 sepsis patients, found nodifferences in any physiologic or outcome measures between the treatment and placebo groups.13-15See ClinicalTrials.gov for a list of clinical trials that are evaluating the use of vitamin C in patients withCOVID-19.Other ConsiderationsIt is important to note that high circulating concentrations of vitamin C may affect the accuracy of pointof-care glucometers.16,17ZincRecommendations\u2022 There is insufficient evidence for the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) torecommend either for or against the use of zinc for the treatment of COVID-19.", "student59": "The Panel recommends against using zinc supplementation above the recommended dietaryallowance for the prevention of COVID-19, except in a clinical trial (BIII).RationaleIncreased intracellular zinc concentrations efficiently impair replication in a number of RNA viruses.1Zinc has been shown to enhance cytotoxicity and induce apoptosis when used in vitro with a zincionophore (e.g., chloroquine). Chloroquine has also been shown to enhance intracellular zinc uptakein vitro.2 The relationship between zinc and COVID-19, including how zinc deficiency affects theseverity of COVID-19 and whether zinc supplements can improve clinical outcomes, is currently underinvestigation.3 Zinc levels are difficult to measure accurately, as zinc is distributed as a component ofvarious proteins and nucleic acids.4Several clinical trials are currently investigating the use of zinc supplementation alone or in combinationwith hydroxychloroquine for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 (see ClinicalTrials.gov formore information about ongoing studies). The recommended dietary allowance for elemental zinc is11 mg daily for men and 8 mg for nonpregnant women.5 The doses used in registered clinical trials forpatients with COVID-19 vary between studies, with a maximum dose of zinc sulfate 220 mg (50 mg ofelemental zinc) twice daily. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend either for oragainst the use of zinc for the treatment of COVID-19.Long-term zinc supplementation can cause copper deficiency with subsequent reversible hematologicdefects (i.e., anemia, leukopenia) and potentially irreversible neurologic manifestations (i.e.,myelopathy, paresthesia, ataxia, spasticity).6,7 The use of zinc supplementation for durations as short as10 months has been associated with copper deficiency.", "student60": "4 In addition, oral zinc can decrease the absorptionof medications that bind with polyvalent cations.5 Because zinc has not been shown to have a clinicalbenefit and may be harmful, the Panel recommends against using zinc supplementation above therecommended dietary allowance for the prevention of COVID-19, except in a clinical trial (BIII).Clinical DataRandomized Clinical Trial of Zinc Plus Hydroxychloroquine Versus HydroxychloroquineAlone in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19In a randomized clinical trial that was conducted at three academic medical centers in Egypt, 191patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were randomized to receive either zinc 220mg twice daily plus hydroxychloroquine or hydroxychloroquine alone for a 5-day course. The primaryendpoints were recovery within 28 days, the need for mechanical ventilation, and death. The two armswere matched for age and gender.8Results\u2022 There were no significant differences between the two arms in the percentages of patients whorecovered within 28 days (79.2% in the hydroxychloroquine plus zinc arm vs. 77.9% in thehydroxychloroquine only arm; P = 0.969), the need for mechanical ventilation (P = 0.537), orDownloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 300overall mortality (P = 0.986).\u2022 The only risk factors for mortality were age and the need for mechanical ventilation.Limitations\u2022 This study had a relatively small sample size.InterpretationA moderately sized randomized clinical trial failed to find a clinical benefit for the combination of zincand hydroxychloroquine.Open-Label, Randomized Trial of Zinc Versus Ascorbic Acid Versus Zinc Plus Ascorbic AcidVersus Standard of Care in Outpatients With COVID-19In an open-label clinical trial that was conducted at two sites in the United States, outpatients withlaboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were randomized to receive either 10 days of zincgluconate 50 mg, ascorbic acid 8,000 mg, both agents, or standard of care.

One hundred and ninety-sixpatients (81.0%) received a total daily dose of zinc sulfate 440 mg (100 mg of elemental zinc); of those,191 patients (97%) also received hydroxychloroquine. Among the 46 patients who did not receivezinc, 32 patients (70%) received hydroxychloroquine. The primary outcome was days from hospitaladmission to in-hospital mortality, and the primary analysis explored the causal association between zinctherapy and survival.10Downloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 301Results\u2022 There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the arms. In the zinc arm,73 patients (37.2%) died compared with 21 patients (45.7%) in the control arm. In the primaryanalysis, which used inverse probability weighting (IPW), the effect estimate of zinc therapy wasan additional 0.84 days of survival (95% CI, -1.51 days to 3.20 days; P = 0.48).\u2022 In a multivariate Cox regression analysis with IPW, the use of zinc sulfate was not significantlyassociated with a change in the risk of in-hospital mortality (aHR 0.66; 95% CI, 0.41\u20131.07; P =0.09).\u2022 Older age, male sex, and severe or critical COVID-19 were significantly associated with anincreased risk of in-hospital mortality.Limitations\u2022 This is a retrospective study; patients were not randomized to receive zinc supplementation or toreceive no zinc.InterpretationThis single-center, retrospective study failed to find a mortality benefit in patients who received zincsupplementation.Multicenter, Retrospective Cohort Study That Compared Hospitalized Patients Who ReceivedZinc Plus Hydroxychloroquine to Those Who Did NotThis study has not been peer reviewed.This multicenter, retrospective cohort study of hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection whowere admitted to four New York City hospitals between March 10 and May 20, 2020, compared patientswho received zinc plus hydroxychloroquine to those who received treatment that did not include thiscombination.11Results\u2022 The records of 3,473 patients were reviewed.\u2022 The median patient age was 64 years; 1,947 patients (56%) were male, and 522 patients (15%)were mechanically ventilated.\u2022 Patients who received an interleukin-6 inhibitor or remdesivir were excluded from the analysis.\u2022 A total of 1,006 patients (29%) received zinc plus hydroxychloroquine, and 2,467 patients (71%)received hydroxychloroquine without zinc.\u2022 During the study, 545 patients (16%) died. In univariate analyses, mortality rates weresignificantly lower among patients who received zinc plus hydroxychloroquine than among thosewho did not (12% vs. 17%; P < 0.001). Similarly, hospital discharge rates were significantlyhigher among patients who received zinc plus hydroxychloroquine than among those who did not(72% vs. 67%; P < 0.001).\u2022 In a Cox regression analysis that adjusted for confounders, treatment with zinc plushydroxychloroquine was associated with a significantly reduced risk of in-hospital death (aHR0.76; 95% CI, 0.60\u20130.96; P = 0.023). Treatment with zinc alone (n = 1,097) did not affectmortality (aHR 1.14; 95% CI, 0.89\u20131.44; P = 0.296), and treatment with hydroxychloroquinealone (n = 2,299) appeared to be harmful (aHR 1.60; 95% CI, 1.22\u20132.11; P = 0.001).\u2022 There were no significant interactions between zinc plus hydroxychloroquine and other COVID19-specific medications.Downloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 302Limitations\u2022 This is a retrospective review; patients were not randomized to receive zinc plushydroxychloroquine or to receive other treatments.\u2022 The authors do not have data on whether patients were taking zinc and/or hydroxychloroquineprior to study admission.\u2022 The arms were not balanced; recipients of zinc plus hydroxychloroquine were more likely to bemale, Black, or to have a higher body mass index and diabetes.

See Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized AdultsWith COVID-19, Corticosteroids, and Special Considerations in Pregnancy for specificrecommendations.Oral corticosteroid therapy prescribed for an underlying medical condition (e.g., primary or secondaryadrenal insufficiency, rheumatological diseases) should be continued in patients after the diagnosis ofCOVID-19.7 Supplemental or stress-dose steroids may be indicated in individual cases.Inhaled corticosteroids that are used daily by patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonarydisease to control airway inflammation should not be discontinued in patients with COVID-19. A large,retrospective study of adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma found thatthose who were prescribed high doses of inhaled corticosteroids had a higher risk of mortality than thosewho received other inhaled medications without corticosteroids; however, the study had limitations.8 Infact, the authors suggested that this association may have been due to differences between the groupsDownloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 305in the severity of the underlying disease rather than a harmful effect of the inhaled corticosteroids. Forpatients with COVID-19 who require nebulized corticosteroids, precautions should be taken to minimizethe potential for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the home and in health care settings.9,10 Please seeCorticosteroids for a summary of the clinical data on using inhaled corticosteroids to manage COVID-19in outpatients.The use of corticosteroids has been associated with delayed viral clearance and/or worse clinicaloutcomes in patients with other viral respiratory infections.11-13 Some studies have suggested thatsystemic corticosteroids slow SARS-CoV-2 clearance, especially when they are administered earlierin the course of infection.14-18 There is insufficient evidence to identify a relationship between inhaledcorticosteroid use and the speed of viral clearance.HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (Statins)Recommendations\u2022 Patients with COVID-19 who are receiving statin therapy for an underlying condition shouldnot discontinue these medications unless discontinuation is otherwise warranted by their clinicalcondition (AIII).\u2022 The Panel recommends against the use of statins for the treatment of COVID-19, except in aclinical trial (AIII).HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, or statins, affect ACE2 as part of their function in reducing endothelialdysfunction. It has been proposed that these agents may have a potential role in managing patients withsevere COVID-19.19A large observational study in China found that hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who receivedstatins had a lower risk of all-cause mortality than patients who did not receive statins (aHR 0.63; 95%CI, 0.48\u20130.84; P = 0.001).20 In contrast, a retrospective, multicenter study of critically ill patients withCOVID-19 in Italy found no association between the long-term use of statins and mortality (aHR 0.98;95% CI, 0.81\u20131.20; P = 0.87).21 Similarly, recent receipt of statin therapy was not associated with ahigher mortality risk (aHR 0.96; 95% CI, 0.78\u20131.18) or the severity of disease (aHR 1.16; 95% CI,0.95\u20131.41) in a national cohort study of 4,842 patients with COVID-19 in Denmark.22More data are needed to clarify the impact of statin therapy on COVID-19. Clinical trials that areevaluating the therapeutic impact of statins as an adjunctive therapy for COVID-19 are currentlyunderway.

Ithas been proposed that NSAIDs can increase the expression of ACE22 and inhibit antibody production.23Shortly after these reports, the Food and Drug Administration stated that there is no evidence linking theuse of NSAIDs with worsening of COVID-19 and advised patients to use NSAIDs as directed.24Downloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 306In a national cohort study of patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in Denmark, noassociation was found between a history of NSAID use and the need for hospitalization, the risk ofmortality, or the severity of illness.25Acid-Suppressive TherapyRecommendations", "student65": "Patients with COVID-19 who are receiving acid-suppressive therapy for an underlying conditionshould not discontinue these medications unless discontinuation is otherwise warranted by theirclinical condition (AIII).\u2022 The Panel recommends against the use of famotidine for the treatment of COVID-19, except in aclinical trial (AIII).Acid-suppressive therapies, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine-2 receptor antagonists(H2RAs), increase gastric pH. Low gastric pH is proposed to be a protective mechanism againstinfection with viruses that can enter the body through the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., enteric viruses,SARS-CoV).26 Observational studies that have evaluated the relationship between the use of acidsuppressive therapy and the acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 disease severity have producedmixed results.A propensity-matched cohort study in South Korea observed that current PPI use was not associatedwith a higher risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, but it was associated with a higher risk of severeillness.27 An online survey conducted in the United States identified no association between the use ofH2RAs and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, while PPI therapy was associated with higher odds ofreceiving a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in those who received twice-daily doses ofPPIs.26 However, these studies had the inherent limitations of observational studies and studies that relyon surveys, and they likely had multiple confounding factors.The impact of the H2RA famotidine on COVID-19 outcomes has been evaluated in observationalstudies. In a retrospective study of 878 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the patients who receivedfamotidine (n = 83) had lower odds of death than those who did not.28 In another retrospective study of84 patients who received famotidine and a matched comparator group of 420 patients who did not, theuse of famotidine was associated with a reduction in the composite outcome of death or intubation.29Only a small proportion of the patients enrolled in these studies received famotidine, and it is unclearwhat the indications for famotidine therapy were or whether there were other confounding factors. Theselimitations make it difficult to draw conclusions about the efficacy of using famotidine to treat patientswith COVID-19.Results from ongoing clinical trials will provide more insights into the role of famotidine in thetreatment of COVID-19.

See Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized AdultsWith COVID-19, Corticosteroids, and Special Considerations in Pregnancy for specificrecommendations.Oral corticosteroid therapy prescribed for an underlying medical condition (e.g., primary or secondaryadrenal insufficiency, rheumatological diseases) should be continued in patients after the diagnosis ofCOVID-19.7 Supplemental or stress-dose steroids may be indicated in individual cases.Inhaled corticosteroids that are used daily by patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonarydisease to control airway inflammation should not be discontinued in patients with COVID-19. A large,retrospective study of adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma found thatthose who were prescribed high doses of inhaled corticosteroids had a higher risk of mortality than thosewho received other inhaled medications without corticosteroids; however, the study had limitations.8 Infact, the authors suggested that this association may have been due to differences between the groupsDownloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 305in the severity of the underlying disease rather than a harmful effect of the inhaled corticosteroids. Forpatients with COVID-19 who require nebulized corticosteroids, precautions should be taken to minimizethe potential for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the home and in health care settings.9,10 Please seeCorticosteroids for a summary of the clinical data on using inhaled corticosteroids to manage COVID-19in outpatients.The use of corticosteroids has been associated with delayed viral clearance and/or worse clinicaloutcomes in patients with other viral respiratory infections.11-13 Some studies have suggested thatsystemic corticosteroids slow SARS-CoV-2 clearance, especially when they are administered earlierin the course of infection.14-18 There is insufficient evidence to identify a relationship between inhaledcorticosteroid use and the speed of viral clearance.HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (Statins)Recommendations\u2022 Patients with COVID-19 who are receiving statin therapy for an underlying condition shouldnot discontinue these medications unless discontinuation is otherwise warranted by their clinicalcondition (AIII)", "student69": "The Panel recommends against the use of statins for the treatment of COVID-19, except in aclinical trial (AIII).HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, or statins, affect ACE2 as part of their function in reducing endothelialdysfunction. It has been proposed that these agents may have a potential role in managing patients withsevere COVID-19.19A large observational study in China found that hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who receivedstatins had a lower risk of all-cause mortality than patients who did not receive statins (aHR 0.63; 95%CI, 0.48\u20130.84; P = 0.001).20 In contrast, a retrospective, multicenter study of critically ill patients withCOVID-19 in Italy found no association between the long-term use of statins and mortality (aHR 0.98;95% CI, 0.81\u20131.20; P = 0.87).21 Similarly, recent receipt of statin therapy was not associated with ahigher mortality risk (aHR 0.96; 95% CI, 0.78\u20131.18) or the severity of disease (aHR 1.16; 95% CI,0.95\u20131.41) in a national cohort study of 4,842 patients with COVID-19 in Denmark.22More data are needed to clarify the impact of statin therapy on COVID-19. Clinical trials that areevaluating the therapeutic impact of statins as an adjunctive therapy for COVID-19 are currentlyunderway. Please see ClinicalTrials.gov for the latest information.Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory DrugsRecommendations\u2022 Patients with COVID-19 who are receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)for an underlying medical condition should not discontinue therapy unless discontinuation isotherwise warranted by their clinical condition (AIII).", "student70": "Strategies for using antipyretic therapy (e.g., acetaminophen, NSAIDs) in patients withCOVID-19 should remain similar to the approaches used in other patients (AIII).In March 2020, news agencies promoted reports that anti-inflammatory drugs may worsen COVID-19. Ithas been proposed that NSAIDs can increase the expression of ACE22 and inhibit antibody production.23Shortly after these reports, the Food and Drug Administration stated that there is no evidence linking theuse of NSAIDs with worsening of COVID-19 and advised patients to use NSAIDs as directed.24Downloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 306In a national cohort study of patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in Denmark, noassociation was found between a history of NSAID use and the need for hospitalization, the risk ofmortality, or the severity of illness.25Acid-Suppressive TherapyRecommendations\u2022 Patients with COVID-19 who are receiving acid-suppressive therapy for an underlying conditionshould not discontinue these medications unless discontinuation is otherwise warranted by theirclinical condition (AIII).\u2022 The Panel recommends against the use of famotidine for the treatment of COVID-19, except in aclinical trial (AIII).Acid-suppressive therapies, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine-2 receptor antagonists(H2RAs), increase gastric pH. Low gastric pH is proposed to be a protective mechanism againstinfection with viruses that can enter the body through the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., enteric viruses,SARS-CoV).26 Observational studies that have evaluated the relationship between the use of acidsuppressive therapy and the acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 disease severity have producedmixed results.A propensity-matched cohort study in South Korea observed that current PPI use was not associatedwith a higher risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, but it was associated with a higher risk of severeillness.27 An online survey conducted in the United States identified no association between the use ofH2RAs and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, while PPI therapy was associated with higher odds ofreceiving a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in those who received twice-daily doses ofPPIs.26 However, these studies had the inherent limitations of observational studies and studies that relyon surveys, and they likely had multiple confounding factors.The impact of the H2RA famotidine on COVID-19 outcomes has been evaluated in observationalstudies. In a retrospective study of 878 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the patients who receivedfamotidine (n = 83) had lower odds of death than those who did not.28 In another retrospective study of84 patients who received famotidine and a matched comparator group of 420 patients who did not, theuse of famotidine was associated with a reduction in the composite outcome of death or intubation.29Only a small proportion of the patients enrolled in these studies received famotidine, and it is unclearwhat the indications for famotidine therapy were or whether there were other confounding factors. Theselimitations make it difficult to draw conclusions about the efficacy of using famotidine to treat patientswith COVID-19.Results from ongoing clinical trials will provide more insights into the role of famotidine in thetreatment of COVID-19.

Dataon the pathogenesis and disease severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children are increasing but arestill limited compared to the data in adults. Several large epidemiologic studies suggest that severemanifestations of acute disease are substantially less common in children than in adults. Althoughonly a small percentage of children with COVID-19 will require medical attention, intensive care unit(ICU)-admission rates for hospitalized children are comparable to those for hospitalized adults withCOVID-19.2-10Clinical ManifestationsThe signs and symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children may be similar to those in adults,but most children may be asymptomatic or only have a few symptoms. The most common signs andsymptoms of COVID-19 in hospitalized children are fever, nausea/vomiting, cough, shortness ofbreath, and upper respiratory symptoms.9,11 Of note, signs and symptoms of COVID-19 may overlapsignificantly with those of other viral infections, including influenza and other respiratory and entericviral infections. Although the true incidence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown,asymptomatic infection was reported in up to 45% of children who underwent surveillance testing at thetime of hospitalization for a non-COVID-19 indication.12SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with a potentially severe inflammatory syndrome in children andyoung adults (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children [MIS-C]), which is discussed below.Risk FactorsData to clearly establish risk factors for severe COVID-19 in children are limited. Data reported to CDCshow lower hospitalization rates and ICU admission rates for children with COVID-19 than for adultswith the disease.11,13 COVID-19-related hospitalization rates for children were highest in children aged<2 years and higher in Hispanic and Black children than in White children. The majority of hospitalizedchildren with acute COVID-19 had underlying conditions, with obesity, chronic lung disease, andprematurity (data collected only for children aged <2 years) being the most prevalent.14 Risk factors suchas obesity may be more applicable to older teenagers.In a large study of hospitalized children from the United Kingdom, age <1 month, age 10 to 14 years,and Black race were associated with admission to critical care unit on multivariate analysis.9 Anotherlarge multicenter study from Europe identified male sex, pre-existing medical conditions, and thepresence of lower respiratory tract disease at presentation as additional risk factors for ICU admission inmultivariable models.10Deaths associated with COVID-19 among those aged <21 years are higher among children aged10 to 20 years, especially young adults aged 18 to 20 years, as well as among Hispanic, Black, andAmerican Indian/Alaska Native persons.15 A high proportion of the fatal cases of pediatric COVID-19are in children with underlying medical conditions, most commonly chronic lung disease, obesity, andneurologic and developmental disorders.Downloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 317Based on data for adults with COVID-19 and extrapolations from data for non-COVID-19 pediatricrespiratory viral infections, severely immunocompromised children and those with underlyingcardiopulmonary disease may be at higher risk for severe COVID-19.", "student74": "Initial reports of SARS-CoV-2infection among pediatric patients with cancer and pediatric solid organ transplant recipients havedemonstrated a low frequency of infection and associated morbidity;16-20 however, similar reports forother immunocompromised pediatric populations are limited.21 A few reports have demonstrated ahigher prevalence of asthma in pediatric COVID-19 cases, although the association of asthma withsevere disease is not clearly defined.7,8 Congenital heart disease may be associated with increased risk ofsevere COVID-19, but the condition has not been consistently identified as a risk factor.22,23 Guidance onthe treatment of COVID-19 in children endorsed by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society specifiesadditional risk factors to consider when making decisions about antiviral and monoclonal antibodytherapy for pediatric patients.24,25Persistent symptoms after acute COVID-19 have been described in adults, although the incidence ofthis sequelae in children remains unknown and is an active area of research (see Clinical Spectrum ofSARS-CoV-2 Infection). Cardiac imaging studies have described myocardial injury in young athleteswho had only mild disease;26 additional studies are needed to determine long-term cardiac sequelae.Vertical Transmission and Infants Born to Mothers with SARS-CoV-2 InfectionVertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be rare, but suspected or probable verticaltransmission has been described.27-29 Initial data on perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 were limitedto small case series with conflicting results; some studies demonstrated lack of transmission, whereasothers were not able to definitively rule out this possibility.30-33 Among 100 women with SARS-CoV-2infection who delivered 101 infants, only two infants had equivocal reverse transcription polymerasechain reaction (RT-PCR) results that may have reflected SARS-CoV-2 infection even though most ofthe infants remained with their mothers, in rooms with infection prevention measures in place, and werebreast fed.34Infants born to individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection may have higher risk of poor clinicaloutcomes than those born to individuals without SARS-CoV-2 infection, although data are conflicting.In a systematic review of case series in pregnant women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection(predominantly from China), the preterm birth rate was 20.1% (57 of 284 births were preterm; 95%CI, 15.8\u201325.1), the cesarean delivery rate was 84.7% (33 of 392 births were by cesarean delivery;95% CI, 80.8\u201387.9), there was no vertical transmission, and the neonatal death rate was 0.3% (1 of313 neonates died; 95% CI, 0.1\u20131.8).", "student75": "In a prospective cohort study of 263 infants born in the UnitedStates, the rates for preterm births, neonatal ICU admissions, and respiratory disease did not differbetween infants born to mothers with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection.36 A cohort study fromSweden demonstrated that 5-minute Apgar scores and birth weight for gestational age did not differbetween infants born to mothers with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection.37 Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19)-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) data from CDC thatcaptured 598 hospitalized, pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection showed a pregnancy loss rateof 2% among 458 pregnancies completed during COVID-19-related hospitalizations and a pretermbirth rate of 12.9% compared to 10% for the general U.S. population.38 A systematic review and metaanalysis of studies that included 2,567 pregnancies concluded that SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers wereat increased risk of iatrogenic preterm birth. This risk was predominantly due to caesarean sections(21.8% of births) performed due to maternal illness and fear of maternal decompensation.", "student76": "In contrast,there was no increase in the rate of spontaneous preterm birth relative to the expected rate in pregnantindividuals without SARS-CoV-2 infection.39,40 Finally, a prospective cohort study from the UnitedKingdom of 66 neonates with SARS-CoV-2 infection found that 3% may have had vertically acquiredDownloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 318infection and 12% had suspected nosocomially acquired infection.29 Specific guidance on the diagnosisand management of COVID-19 in neonates born to mothers with known or suspected SARS-CoV-2infection is provided by CDC.Treatment ConsiderationsThere are no results available from clinical trials evaluating treatment for COVID-19 in children, andobservational data on the safety or efficacy of drug therapy in children with COVID-19 are extremelylimited. More high-quality studies, including randomized trials, are urgently needed. Guidancefor the treatment of COVID-19 in children has been published and is mostly extrapolated fromrecommendations for adults with COVID-19.41,42 The older the child and the more severe the disease,the more reasonable it is to follow recommendations for adult patients with COVID-19 (see TherapeuticManagement of Nonhospitalized Adults With COVID-19 and Therapeutic Management of HospitalizedAdults With COVID-19). To address the uncertain safety and efficacy of these treatment options,children should be enrolled in clinical trials and multicenter pragmatic trials whenever possible.The majority of children with mild or moderate COVID-19 will not progress to more severe illness andthus should be managed with supportive care alone (AIII).", "student77": "The risks and benefits of therapy should beassessed based on illness severity, age, and the presence of risk factors outlined above.RemdesivirRemdesivir is the only drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatmentof COVID-19 (see Remdesivir for detailed information). It is approved for the treatment of COVID-19in hospitalized adult and pediatric patients (aged \u226512 years and weighing \u226540 kg). It is also availablethrough an FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalizedpediatric patients weighing 3.5 kg to <40 kg or aged <12 years and weighing \u22653.5 kg.43 Remdesivir hasnot been evaluated in clinical trials that include children, and there have been no results from systematicevaluations of pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or toxicity in younger children, although studies are ongoing(see ClinicalTrials.gov). However, based on adult data, the potential benefits of remdesivir are likely tobe greater for hospitalized children with COVID-19 who are at higher risk of progression due to olderage (i.e., aged \u226516 years) or medical condition than for those without these risk factors. Remdesiviris recommended for hospitalized children aged \u226512 years with COVID-19 who have risk factors forsevere disease and have an emergent or increasing need for supplemental oxygen (BIII). Remdesivir isalso recommended for hospitalized children aged \u226516 years with COVID-19 who have an emergent orincreasing need for supplemental oxygen even in the absence of risk factors (BIII).", "student78": "Remdesivir can beconsidered for other hospitalized children of all ages with COVID-19 who have an emergent or increasingneed for supplemental oxygen in consultation with a pediatric infectious disease specialist (CIII).DexamethasoneDexamethasone is recommended for the treatment of hospitalized adults with COVID-19 who requiremechanical ventilation or supplemental oxygen through a high-flow device (see Corticosteroids andTherapeutic Management of Hospitalized Adults With COVID-19 for detailed information). Thesafety and effectiveness of dexamethasone or other corticosteroids for COVID-19 treatment havenot been sufficiently evaluated in pediatric patients and thus caution is warranted when extrapolatingrecommendations for adults to patients aged <18 years. The COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel(the Panel) recommends using dexamethasone for children with COVID-19 who require high-flowoxygen, noninvasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membraneoxygenation (ECMO) (BIII). It is not routinely recommended for pediatric patients who require onlylow levels of oxygen support (i.e., via a nasal cannula only). Use of dexamethasone for the treatment ofsevere COVID-19 in children who are profoundly immunocompromised has not been evaluated, mayDownloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 319be harmful, and therefore should be considered only on a case-by-case basis. If dexamethasone is notavailable, alternative glucocorticoids such as prednisone, methylprednisolone, or hydrocortisone can beconsidered. The dexamethasone dosing regimen for pediatric patients is dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg/dose(maximum dose 6 mg) once daily for up to 10 days.Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Monoclonal AntibodiesAlthough EUAs have been issued for bamlanivimab plus etesevimab and casirivimab plus imdevimabfor the treatment of nonhospitalized, high-risk patients aged \u226512 years and weighing \u226540 kg withmild to moderate COVID-19, there are currently no data available to determine which high-riskpediatric patients defined in the EUAs will likely benefit from these therapies. Consequently, thereis insufficient evidence for the Panel to recommend either for or against the use of these monoclonalantibodies in children with COVID-19 who are not hospitalized but are at high risk of severe diseaseand/or hospitalization. In consultation with a pediatric infectious disease specialist, bamlanivimab plusetesevimab or casirivimab plus imdevimab can be considered on a case-by-case basis for children whomeet the EUA criteria, but should not be considered routine care. This recommendation is primarilybased on the absence of data assessing efficacy or safety in children or adolescents, limited data withwhich to identify children at the highest risk of severe COVID-19, as well as the low overall risk ofprogression to serious disease in children, and the potential risk associated with infusion reactions.Additional guidance is provided in a recent publication endorsed by the Pediatric Infectious DiseasesSociety.25 There are currently no data to support the use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies inhospitalized children for COVID-19. Emerging data regarding the prevalence and clinical significanceof SARS-CoV-2 variants, and the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies against variants, may inform thechoice of specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody therapy in the future.Convalescent PlasmaFDA has also issued an EUA for the use of high-titer convalescent plasma for the treatment ofhospitalized patients with COVID-19 (see Convalescent Plasma for detailed information).44 The safetyand efficacy of convalescent plasma have not been evaluated in pediatric patients with COVID-19.There is insufficient evidence for the Panel to recommend either for or against the use of convalescentplasma for the treatment of COVID-19 in either pediatric outpatients or in hospitalized children who donot require mechanical ventilation. The Panel recommends against the use of convalescent plasmafor pediatric patients with COVID-19 who are mechanically ventilated (AIII). In consultation with apediatric infectious disease specialist, convalescent plasma may be considered on a case-by-case basisfor children who meet the EUA criteria for its use.BaricitinibFDA has also issued an EUA for the use of baricitinib in combination with remdesivir in hospitalizedadults and children aged \u22652 years with COVID-19 who require supplemental oxygen, invasivemechanical ventilation, or ECMO.45 The safety and efficacy of baricitinib have not been evaluated inpediatric patients with COVID-19, and pediatric data regarding its use for other conditions are extremelylimited. Thus, there is insufficient evidence for the Panel to recommend either for or against the use ofbaricitinib in combination with remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized children inwhom corticosteroids cannot be used (see Kinase Inhibitors for detailed information).TocilizumabData on tocilizumab use for the treatment of non-COVID-19 conditions in children are limited to veryspecific clinical scenarios (e.g., chimeric antigen receptor T cell-related cytokine release syndrome).46Downloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 320The use of tocilizumab for severe cases of acute COVID-19 has been described in pediatric caseseries.14,47 Data on tocilizumab efficacy from trials in adults with COVID-19 are conflicting, and benefithas only been demonstrated in a subset of hospitalized patients (see Interleukin-6 Inhibitors). Thereis insufficient evidence for the Panel to recommend either for or against the use of tocilizumab forhospitalized children with COVID-19 or MIS-C. If used, tocilizumab should be used in combinationwith dexamethasone.", "student79": "The Panel recommends against the use of sarilumab for hospitalized childrenwith COVID-19 or MIS-C, except in a clinical trial (AIII).As for other agents outlined in these Guidelines, there is insufficient evidence for the Panel torecommend either for or against the use of specific antivirals or immunomodulatory agents for thetreatment of COVID-19 in pediatric patients. Considerations, such as underlying conditions, diseaseseverity, and potential for drug toxicity or drug interactions, may inform decisions on the use of theseagents in pediatric patients with COVID-19 on a case-by-case basis. Children should be enrolledin clinical trials evaluating COVID-19 therapies whenever possible. A number of additional drugsare being investigated for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults; refer to the Antiviral Therapy andImmunomodulators sections to review special considerations for use of these drugs in children and referto Table 2e and Table 4e for recommendations on pediatric dosing regimens.Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in ChildrenA small subset of children and young adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection develop MIS-C. Thisimmune manifestation is also referred to as pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome\u2013temporallyassociated with SARS-CoV-2 (PMIS-TS), although the case definitions for the syndromes differslightly. This syndrome was first described in Europe, where previously healthy children with severeinflammation and Kawasaki disease-like features were identified to have current or recent infection withSARS-CoV-2. The clinical spectrum of MIS-C has been described in the United States and is similar tothat described for PIMS-TS. MIS-C is consistent with a post-infectious inflammatory syndrome relatedto SARS-CoV-2.48,49 Most MIS-C patients have serologic evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection,but only a minority are RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 at presentation.50,51 The peak incidence ofMIS-C lags about 4 weeks behind the peak of acute pediatric COVID-19 hospitalizations. Emerging datasuggests that adults may also develop a similar syndrome, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults(MIS-A), although it is not clear if this is a postinfectious complication similar to MIS-C.50-52 Althoughrisk factors for MIS-C have not been established, in an analysis of MIS-C cases in the United States,most of the children were nonwhite, and obesity was the most common comorbidity.53 Unlike in childrenwith acute COVID-19, the majority of children who present with MIS-C do not seem to have underlyingcomorbid conditions other than obesity.Clinical ManifestationsThe current CDC case definition for MIS-C includes:\u2022 An individual aged <21 years presenting with fever,a laboratory evidence of inflammation,b andevidence of clinically severe illness requiring hospitalization with multisystem (i.e., more thantwo) organ involvement (cardiac, renal, respiratory, hematologic, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, orneurological); and\u2022 No alternative plausible diagnoses; and\u2022 Positive for current or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR, antigen test, or serology; orCOVID-19 exposure within the 4 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.54a Fever >38.0\u00b0C for \u226524 hours or report of subjective fever lasting \u226524 hoursb Including, but not limited to one or more of the following: an elevated C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentationDownloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 321rate, fibrinogen, procalcitonin, d-dimer, ferritin, lactic acid dehydrogenase, interleukin (IL)-6, or neutrophils, or reducedlymphocytes or albumin levelsDistinguishing MIS-C from other febrile illnesses in the community setting remains challenging, butpresence of persistent fever, multisystem manifestations, and laboratory abnormalities could helpearly recognition.", "student80": "The clinical spectrum of hospitalized cases has included younger children withmucocutaneous manifestations that overlap those with Kawasaki disease, older children with moremultiorgan involvement and shock, and patients with respiratory manifestations that overlap withacute COVID-19. Patients with MIS-C are often critically ill and up to 80% of children require ICUadmission.53 Most patients with MIS-C have markers of cardiac injury or dysfunction, including elevatedlevels of troponin and brain natriuretic protein.50,51 Echocardiographic findings in these cases includeimpaired left ventricular function, as well as coronary artery dilations, and rarely, coronary arteryaneurysms. Reported mortality rate in the United States for hospitalized children with MIS-C is 1% to2%. Longitudinal studies are currently ongoing to examine the long-term sequelae of MIS-C.The pathogenesis of MIS-C is still being elucidated. Differences have been demonstrated betweenMIS-C and typical Kawasaki disease in terms of epidemiology, cytopenias, cytokine expression, andelevation of inflammatory markers. Immunologic profiling has also shown differences in cytokineexpression (tumor necrosis factor alpha and IL-10) between MIS-C and acute COVID-19 in children.56-58ManagementCurrently, there are only observational data available to guide treatment for MIS-C. Supportive careremains the mainstay of therapy. There is currently insufficient evidence for the Panel to recommendeither for or against any specific therapeutic strategy for the management of MIS-C. MIS-C managementdecisions should involve a multidisciplinary team of pediatric specialists including experts in intensivecare, infectious diseases, cardiology, hematology, and rheumatology. Although no clinical trial dataare available, many centers have described the use of immunomodulatory therapy (e.g., intravenousimmune globulin [IVIG], corticosteroids, IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors). The American College ofRheumatology has outlined initial diagnostic and treatment considerations for MIS-C, recommendingIVIG and/or corticosteroids as first-tier therapies and other biologic agents as second-line options.48,49,59An observational study from Europe used propensity matching to compare short-term outcomes inchildren with MIS-C who were treated initially with IVIG alone or IVIG and methylprednisolone. Theyobserved a lower risk of treatment failure (defined as persistence of fever), more rapid improvement inhemodynamic support, less severe left ventricular dysfunction, and shorter ICU stays among childreninitially treated with the combination therapy.60 These findings must be confirmed with additionalprospective studies. The role of antiviral therapy in MIS-C is not clear, therefore the use of remdesivirshould be reserved for patients who have features of acute COVID-19.", "student81": "Summary Recommendations\u2022 Given the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines in the general population and the increased risk of severe COVID-19and mortality in patients with cancer, the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) recommends COVID-19vaccination for patients with active cancer or patients who are receiving treatment for cancer (AIII).\u2022 Patients who are receiving active cancer therapy may have suboptimal responses to the current two-dose vaccineseries. Because of this, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a third dose of an mRNA vaccinefor these patients. See the text below for additional information on the criteria for receiving a third dose and theappropriate timing for COVID-19 vaccination in these patients.\u2022 Patients with cancer are at high risk of progressing to serious COVID-19, and they may be eligible to receive antiSARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies for treatment or as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).\u2022 The Panel recommends performing molecular diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 in patients with cancer who developsigns and symptoms that suggest COVID-19 (AIII) and in asymptomatic patients prior to procedures that requireanesthesia and before initiating cytotoxic chemotherapy and long-acting biologic therapy (BIII).", "student82": "The recommendations for treating COVID-19 in patients with cancer are the same as those for the general population(AIII).

The optimal management and therapeutic approach to COVID-19 inthis population has not yet been defined.Vaccination for COVID-19 in Patients With CancerThe clinical trials that evaluated the COVID-19 vaccines that have received Emergency UseAuthorizations and/or approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) excluded severelyimmunocompromised patients. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices notes that theauthorized COVID-19 vaccines are not live vaccines; therefore, they can be safely administered toimmunocompromised people.7 Given the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines in the generalpopulation and the increased risk of severe COVID-19 and mortality in patients with cancer, theCOVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) recommends COVID-19 vaccination for patientswith active cancer or patients who are receiving treatment for cancer (AIII). The Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDC) recommends a third dose of an mRNA vaccine for patients who arereceiving active cancer therapy; this third dose should be administered at least 28 days after thecompletion of the initial two-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine series.8 ASH and NCCN have providedadditional recommendations for administering a third vaccine dose in patients with cancer based on thepatient\u2019s tumor type and therapy.9,10The mRNA vaccines contain polyethylene glycol (PEG), and the Johnson & Johnson (J&J)/Janssenvaccine contains polysorbate. In patients who experience a severe anaphylactic reaction to PEGasparaginase, consider performing allergy testing for PEG prior to vaccination with either of the mRNAvaccines, or consider using the J&J/Janssen vaccine with precautions.11-13When determining the timing of COVID-19 vaccination in patients with cancer, clinicians shouldconsider the following factors:\u2022 If possible, patients who are planning to receive chemotherapy should complete vaccination forCOVID-19 at least 2 weeks before starting chemotherapy.9,14\u2022 In patients with hematologic malignancy who are undergoing intensive chemotherapy (e.g.,induction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia)", "student84": "vaccination should be delayed untilneutrophil recovery.15\u2022 Hematopoietic stem cell and chimeric antigen receptor T cell recipients can be offered COVID-19vaccination starting at least 3 months after therapy.14It is unknown whether the immune response to COVID-19 vaccination can increase the risk of graftversus-host disease. Studies of patients who received immune checkpoint inhibitors did not reportimmune-related adverse events in these patients after vaccination.16,17Decreased immunologic responses to COVID-19 vaccination have been reported in patients whowere receiving treatment for solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.18,19 The type of therapyhas been shown to influence the patient\u2019s response to vaccination. For example, people with chroniclymphocytic leukemia who were treated with Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase inhibitors or venetoclax withDownloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 328or without anti-CD20 antibodies had extremely low response rates (16.0% and 13.6%, respectively).19In comparison, approximately 80% to 95% of patients with solid tumors showed immunologicresponses.18,20,21 Currently, it is not known how a third dose of an mRNA vaccine affects response ratesin patients with cancer.Patients with cancer are at high risk of progressing to serious COVID-19, and they may be eligible toreceive anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).Vaccination of household members, close contacts, and health care providers who provide care forimmunocompromised patients is imperative to protect these patients from infection. All close contactsare strongly encouraged to get vaccinated.Testing for SARS-CoV-2 in Patients With CancerThe Panel recommends molecular diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 in patients with cancer whodevelop signs and symptoms of COVID-19 (AIII).Patients with cancer who are receiving chemotherapy are at risk of developing neutropenia. The NCCNGuidelines for Hematopoietic Growth Factors categorizes cancer treatment regimens based on thepatient\u2019s risk of developing neutropenia.22 A retrospective study suggests that patients with cancer andneutropenia have a higher mortality rate if they develop COVID-19.23 Studies have reported an increasedrisk of poor clinical outcomes for patients with COVID-19 in the setting of neutropenia and/or duringthe perioperative period.24,25 Because of this, the Panel recommends performing molecular diagnostictesting for SARS-CoV-2 prior to procedures that require anesthesia and before initiating cytotoxicchemotherapy and long-acting biologic therapy (BIII).General Guidance on Medical Care for Patients With Cancer During the COVID-19PandemicPatients with cancer frequently engage with the health care system to receive treatment and supportivecare for cancer and/or treatment-related complications. Telemedicine can minimize the need forin-person services and reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. CDC has published a framework tohelp clinicians decide whether a patient should receive in-person or virtual care during the COVID-19pandemic; this framework accounts for factors such as the potential harm of delayed care and thedegree of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a patient\u2019s community.26 Telemedicine may improve accessto providers for medically or socially vulnerable populations, but it could worsen disparities if thesepopulations have limited access to technology. Nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to patients andhealth care workers has been reported.27-29 Principles of physical distancing and prevention strategies,including masking patients and health care workers and practicing hand hygiene, apply to all in-personinteractions.30Decisions about treatment regimens, surgery, and radiation therapy for the underlying malignancyshould be made on a case-by-case basis, and clinicians should consider the biology of the cancer,the need for hospitalization, the number of clinic visits required, and the anticipated degree ofimmunosuppression. Additional factors that should be considered include the following:\u2022 If possible, treatment delays should be avoided for curable cancers that have been shown to haveworse outcomes when treatment is delayed (e.g., pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia).\u2022 When deciding between equally effective treatment regimens, regimens that can be administeredorally or those that require fewer infusions are preferred.31\u2022 The potential risks of drug-related lung toxicity (e.g., from using bleomycin or PD-1 inhibitors)Downloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19", "student85": "Treatment Guidelines 329must be balanced with the clinical efficacy of alternative regimens or the risk of delaying care.32\u2022 Preventing neutropenia can decrease the risk of neutropenic fever and the need for emergencydepartment evaluation and hospitalization. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) shouldbe given with chemotherapy regimens that have intermediate (10% to 20%) or high (>20%) risksof febrile neutropenia.33\u2022 Cancer treatment regimens that do not affect the outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with cancermay not need to be altered. In a prospective observational study, receipt of immunotherapy,hormonal therapy, or radiotherapy in the month prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection was not associatedwith an increased risk of mortality among patients with cancer and COVID-19.34 A retrospectivestudy from Italy evaluated the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with prostatecancer and found that 114 of 37,161 patients (0.3%) who were treated with therapies otherthan androgen deprivation therapy became infected, compared to 4 of 5,273 patients (0.08%)who were treated with androgen deprivation therapy (OR 4.05; 95% CI, 1.55\u201310.59).35 A smallcohort study of patients from Finland with prostate cancer did not find an association betweenandrogen deprivation and the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.36 The viral spike proteins thatSARS-CoV-2 uses to enter cells are primed by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), anandrogen-regulated gene. Whether androgen deprivation therapy protects against SARS-CoV-2infection requires further investigation in larger cohorts or clinical trials.35\u2022 Radiation therapy guidelines suggest increasing the dose per fraction and reducing the number ofdaily treatments to minimize the number of hospital visits.37,38Blood supply shortages will likely continue during the COVID-19 pandemic due to social distancing,cancellation of blood drives, and infection among donors. The FDA has proposed revising the donorcriteria to increase the number of eligible donors.39 In patients with cancer, stricter transfusion thresholdsfor blood products (e.g., red blood cells, platelets) in asymptomatic patients should be considered.8 Atthis time, there is no evidence that COVID-19 can be transmitted through blood products.40,41Febrile NeutropeniaPatients with cancer and febrile neutropenia should undergo molecular diagnostic testing forSARS-CoV-2 and evaluation for other infectious agents; they should also be given empiric antibiotics, asoutlined in the NCCN Guidelines.42 Low-risk febrile neutropenia patients should be treated at home withoral antibiotics or intravenous infusions of antibiotics to limit nosocomial exposure to SARS-CoV-2.", "student86": "Patients with high-risk febrile neutropenia should be hospitalized per standard of care.42 Empiricantibiotics should be continued per standard of care in patients who test positive for SARS-CoV-2.Clinicians should also continuously evaluate neutropenic patients for emergent infections.Treating COVID-19 and Managing Chemotherapy in Patients With Cancer andCOVID-19Retrospective studies suggest that patients with cancer who were admitted to the hospital withSARS-CoV-2 infection have a high case-fatality rate, with higher rates observed in patients withhematologic malignancies than in those with solid tumors.43,44The recommendations for treating COVID-19 in patients with cancer are the same as those for thegeneral population (AIII). See Therapeutic Management of Nonhospitalized Adults With COVID-19 andTherapeutic Management of Hospitalized Adults With COVID-19 for more information. Patients withcancer are at high risk of progressing to serious COVID-19, and they may be eligible to receive antiSARS-CoV-2 mAbs as treatment if they develop mild to moderate COVID-19.Downloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 330Dexamethasone treatment has been associated with a lower mortality rate in patients with COVID-19who require supplemental oxygen or invasive mechanical ventilation.45 In patients with cancer,dexamethasone is commonly used to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea, as a part of tumor-directedtherapy, and to treat inflammation associated with brain metastasis. The side effects of dexamethasoneare expected to be the same in patients with cancer as in those without cancer. If possible, treatments thatare not currently recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection should be administered as part of a clinicaltrial, since the safety and efficacy of these agents have not been well-defined in patients with cancer.The NCCN recommends against using G-CSF and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor inpatients with cancer and acute SARS-CoV-2 infection who do not have bacterial or fungal infections toavoid the hypothetical risk of increasing inflammatory cytokine levels and pulmonary inflammation.46,47Secondary infections (e.g., invasive pulmonary aspergillosis) have been reported in critically ill patientswith COVID-19.48,49Decisions about administering cancer-directed therapy to patients with acute COVID-19 and those whoare recovering from COVID-19 should be made on a case-by-case basis; clinicians should consider theindication for chemotherapy, the goals of care, and the patient\u2019s history of tolerance to the treatment(BIII). The optimal duration of time between resolution of infection and initiating or restartingcancer-directed therapy is unclear. Withholding treatment until COVID-19 symptoms have resolved isrecommended, if possible. Prolonged viral shedding (detection of SARS-CoV-2 by molecular testing)may occur in patients with cancer,2 although it is unknown how this relates to infectious virus and howit impacts outcomes. Therefore, there is no role for repeat testing in those recovering from COVID-19,and the decision to restart cancer treatments in this setting should be made on a case-by-case basis.Clinicians who are treating COVID-19 in patients with cancer should consult a hematologist oroncologist before adjusting cancer-directed medications (AIII).Medication InteractionsThe use of antiviral or immune-based therapies to treat COVID-19 can present additional challengesin patients with cancer. Clinicians should pay careful attention to potential drug-drug interactions andoverlapping toxicities between drugs that are used to treat COVID-19 and cancer-directed therapies,prophylactic antimicrobials, corticosteroids, and other medications (AIII).Several antineoplastic medications may interact with therapies that are being investigated for COVID19.50,51 For example, tocilizumab can interact with vincristine and doxorubicin.", "student87": "Any COVID-19therapy that may cause QT prolongation must be used with caution in patients who are being treatedwith venetoclax, gilteritinib, or tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy (e.g., nilotinib). Dexamethasone iscommonly used as an antiemetic for patients with cancer and is recommended for the treatment ofcertain patients with COVID-19 (see Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized Adults With COVID-19).Dexamethasone is a weak to moderate cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inducer; therefore, interactionswith any CYP3A4 substrates need to be considered.Special Considerations in ChildrenPreliminary published reports suggest that pediatric patients with cancer may have milder manifestationsof COVID-19 than adult patients with cancer, although larger studies are needed.52-54 Guidance onmanaging children with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic is available from an international groupthat received input from the International Society of Paediatric Oncology, the Children\u2019s OncologyGroup, St. Jude Global, and Childhood Cancer International.55 Two publications include guidance formanaging specific malignancies, guidance for supportive care, and a summary of web links from expertgroups that are relevant to the care of pediatric oncology patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.55,56Downloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 331Special considerations for using antivirals in immunocompromised children, including those withmalignancy, are available in a multicenter guidance statement.", "student88": "Summary RecommendationsPrevention of COVID-19\u2022 The COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) recommends that people with HIV receive COVID-19 vaccinesregardless of their CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell count or HIV viral load, because the potential benefits outweigh thepotential risks (AIII).\u2022 The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that people with advanced or untreated HIV whoreceived a two-dose series of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine should receive a third dose of that vaccine at least 28 daysafter the second dose.

Most of these individualsare in care, and many are on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and have well-controlled disease.1 SimilarDownloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 344to COVID-19, HIV disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minorities and people of lowersocioeconomic status in the United States;2 these demographic groups also appear to have a higher riskof poor outcomes with COVID-19.Information on SARS-CoV-2/HIV coinfection is evolving rapidly. The sections below outline the currentstate of knowledge regarding preventing and diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with HIV,the treatment and clinical outcomes in people with HIV who develop COVID-19, and managing HIVduring the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to these Guidelines, the Department of Health and HumanServices Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents has developed the InterimGuidance for COVID-19 and Persons With HIV.Clinical Outcomes of COVID-19 in People With HIVData are emerging on the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in people with HIV. In a case series ofpeople with COVID-19 in Europe and the United States, no significant differences were observed inthe clinical outcomes of COVID-19 between people with HIV and people who did not have HIV.3-10For example, the Veterans Aging Cohort Study compared the clinical outcomes for 253 veterans withHIV and COVID-19 and the outcomes for a matched comparator arm of 504 veterans without HIV whodeveloped COVID-19. More than 95% of the participants in this study were male. In this comparison, nodifferences were found between the outcomes for patients with HIV and those who did not have HIV.11In contrast, worse outcomes for patients with HIV and COVID-19, including increased COVID-19mortality rates, have been reported by subsequent cohort studies in the United States, the UnitedKingdom, and South Africa.12-18 HIV was independently associated with an increased risk of severeand critical COVID-19 in a large World Health Organization platform trial that included data from 24countries.19 In a multicenter cohort study of 286 patients with HIV and COVID-19 in the United States,lower CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts (i.e., <200 cells/mm3) were associated with a higher riskfor the composite endpoint of intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death.This increased risk was observed even in patients who had achieved virologic suppression of HIV.15 Ina large observational cohort study of people with HIV and COVID-19 in the United States, those withCD4 counts <350 cells/mm3 were more likely to be hospitalized, require ventilation, or die.", "student90": "Higherlevels of viremia were also associated with worse outcomes.18 In another study of 175 patients with HIVand COVID-19, a low CD4 count or a low CD4 nadir was associated with poor outcomes.16 In a cohortstudy conducted in New York, people with HIV and COVID-19 had higher rates of hospitalization andmortality than people with COVID-19 who did not have HIV.17Prevention of COVID-19 in People With HIVThe COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) recommends using the same approach foradvising persons with HIV on the strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection that is used for peoplewithout HIV (AIII). There is currently no clear evidence that any antiretroviral (ARV) medications canprevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.People with HIV should receive COVID-19 vaccines, regardless of their CD4 count or HIV viral load,because the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks (AIII). People with HIV were included in theclinical trials of the two mRNA vaccines and the adenovirus vector vaccine that are currently availablethrough Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) and/or approval from the Food and Drug Administration(FDA);20-22 however, the safety and efficacy of these vaccines in people with HIV have not been fullyreported. Typically, people with HIV who are on ART and who have achieved virologic suppressionrespond well to licensed vaccines. Preliminary data from studies that used COVID-19 vaccines in peoplewith HIV confirm that people who are on ART and have normal CD4 counts have good immunologicresponses to the vaccines.23-25Downloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 345On August 12, 2021, the FDA changed the EUAs for the two mRNA vaccines to allow a third dose ofan mRNA vaccine to be administered at least 28 days after the second dose to people with advanced oruntreated HIV. Advanced HIV is defined as people with CD4 counts <200 cells/mm3, a history of anAIDS-defining illness without immune reconstitution, or clinical manifestations of symptomatic HIV.Guidance for using these vaccines, including guidance for people with HIV, is available through theAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practices. A patient\u2019s HIV status should be kept confidential whenadministering a vaccine.People with HIV who have recently been in close contact with a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection areeligible to receive anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP);however, in situations where there are logistical or supply constraints for administering mAbs, priorityshould be given to those with advanced HIV (AIII). See Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 Infection for thespecific indications for PEP.Diagnostic and Laboratory Testing for COVID-19 in People With HIVDiagnosis of COVID-19 in People With HIVThe Panel recommends using the same approach for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection in people withHIV as in those without HIV (AIII). See Testing for SARS-CoV-2 Infection for more information.There is currently no evidence that the performance characteristics of nucleic acid amplification tests(NAATs) differ in people with and without HIV when diagnosing acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. The Panelrecommends against the use of serologic testing as the sole basis for diagnosis of acute SARS-CoV-2infection (AIII). However, if diagnostic serologic testing is performed in a patient with HIV, the resultsshould be interpreted with caution because cross-reactivity between antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and HIVhas been reported.26Correlation of CD4 Count in People With HIV and COVID-19The normal range for CD4 counts in healthy adults is about 500 to 1,600 cells/mm3. People with HIVwho have a CD4 count of \u2265500 cells/mm3 have similar cellular immune function to those without HIV.In people with HIV, a CD4 count <200 cells/mm3 meets the definition for AIDS. For patients on ART, thehallmark of treatment success is plasma HIV RNA below the level of detection by a polymerase chainreaction assay. Lymphopenia is a common laboratory finding in patients with COVID-19; in patients withHIV, clinicians should note that CD4 counts obtained during acute COVID-19 may not accurately reflectthe patient\u2019s HIV disease stage.", "student91": "There have been some reports of people with advanced HIV who have presented with COVID-19 andanother coinfection, including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.27,28 In patients with advanced HIV whohave suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinicians should consider a broaderdifferential diagnosis for clinical symptoms and consider consulting an HIV specialist (AIII).Clinical Presentation of COVID-19 in People With HIVIt is currently unknown whether people with HIV have a higher incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection ora higher rate of progression to symptomatic disease than the general population. Approximately 50% ofpeople with HIV in the United States are aged >50 years,29 and many have comorbidities that are associatedwith more severe cases of COVID-19. These comorbidities include hypertension, diabetes mellitus,cardiovascular disease, tobacco use disorder, chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, and cancer.30There are a number of case reports and case series that describe the clinical presentation of COVID-19in people with HIV.3-10,31,32 These studies indicate that the clinical presentation of COVID-19 is similar inDownloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 346people with and without HIV. Most of the published reports describe populations in which most of theindividuals with HIV are on ART and have achieved virologic suppression. Consequently, the currentunderstanding of the impact of COVID-19 in those with advanced HIV who have low CD4 counts orpersistent HIV viremia is limited.Management of COVID-19 in People With HIVRecommendations for the triage and management of COVID-19 in people with HIV are the same asthose for the general population (AIII).The treatment of COVID-19 in persons with HIV is the same as for those without HIV (AIII).Nonhospitalized people with HIV and mild to moderate COVID-19 are eligible to receive anti-SARSCoV-2 mAbs for treatment; however, in situations where there are logistical or supply constraints foradministering mAbs, priority should be given to those with advanced HIV (AIII).", "student92": "See Prevention ofSARS-CoV-2 Infection for more information. In hospitalized patients, the appropriate treatment strategydepends on disease severity (see Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized Adults With COVID-19).When starting treatment for COVID-19 in patients with HIV, clinicians should pay careful attentionto potential drug-drug interactions and overlapping toxicities among COVID-19 treatments,ARV medications, antimicrobial therapies, and other medications (AIII). Both tocilizumab anddexamethasone, which are recommended for some patients with severe or critical COVID-19,are immunosuppressive agents. The safety of using these drugs in immunocompromised patients,including those with advanced HIV, has not been studied. Therefore, patients with advanced HIV whoare receiving these drugs should be closely monitored for secondary infections. Dexamethasone is adose-dependent inducer of cytochrome P450 3A4, and it could potentially lower the levels of certaincoadministered ARV drugs. More than a single dose of dexamethasone is not recommended for patientswho are receiving rilpivirine as part of their ARV regimen. Clinicians should consult an HIV specialistbefore administering dexamethasone to these patients. It is currently unknown whether administering\u226410 days of dexamethasone impacts the clinical efficacy of other ARV drugs. Patients with HIV whoare receiving dexamethasone as treatment for COVID-19 should follow up with their HIV providers toassess their virologic response.Although some ARV drugs are being studied for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, no agentshave been shown to be effective.People with HIV should be offered the opportunity to participate in clinical trials of vaccines and potentialtreatments for COVID-19. A variety of immunomodulatory therapies are prescribed empirically oradministered as part of a clinical trial to treat severe COVID-19. The data on whether these medicationsare safe to use in patients with HIV are lacking.", "student93": "If a medication has been shown to reduce the mortality ofpatients with COVID-19 in the general population, it should also be used to treat COVID-19 in patientswith HIV, unless data indicate that the medication is not safe or effective in this population.Managing HIV in People With SARS-CoV-2/HIV CoinfectionBelow are some general considerations regarding the management of HIV in people with SARS-CoV-2/HIV coinfection.\u2022 Whenever possible, ART and opportunistic infection prophylaxis should be continued in apatient with HIV who develops COVID-19, including in those who require hospitalization(AIII). Treatment interruption may lead to rebound viremia, and, in some cases, the emergenceof drug resistance. If the appropriate ARV drugs are not on the hospital\u2019s formulary, administermedications from the patient\u2019s home supplies, if available.Downloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 347\u2022 Clinicians who are treating COVID-19 in people with HIV should consult an HIV specialist beforeadjusting or switching a patient\u2019s ARV medications.

Most of these individualsare in care, and many are on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and have well-controlled disease.1 SimilarDownloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 344to COVID-19, HIV disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minorities and people of lowersocioeconomic status in the United States;2 these demographic groups also appear to have a higher riskof poor outcomes with COVID-19.", "student97": "Information on SARS-CoV-2/HIV coinfection is evolving rapidly. The sections below outline the currentstate of knowledge regarding preventing and diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with HIV,the treatment and clinical outcomes in people with HIV who develop COVID-19, and managing HIVduring the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to these Guidelines, the Department of Health and HumanServices Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents has developed the InterimGuidance for COVID-19 and Persons With HIV.Clinical Outcomes of COVID-19 in People With HIVData are emerging on the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in people with HIV. In a case series ofpeople with COVID-19 in Europe and the United States, no significant differences were observed inthe clinical outcomes of COVID-19 between people with HIV and people who did not have HIV.3-10For example, the Veterans Aging Cohort Study compared the clinical outcomes for 253 veterans withHIV and COVID-19 and the outcomes for a matched comparator arm of 504 veterans without HIV whodeveloped COVID-19. More than 95% of the participants in this study were male. In this comparison, nodifferences were found between the outcomes for patients with HIV and those who did not have HIV.11In contrast, worse outcomes for patients with HIV and COVID-19, including increased COVID-19mortality rates, have been reported by subsequent cohort studies in the United States, the UnitedKingdom, and South Africa.12-18 HIV was independently associated with an increased risk of severeand critical COVID-19 in a large World Health Organization platform trial that included data from 24countries.19 In a multicenter cohort study of 286 patients with HIV and COVID-19 in the United States,lower CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts (i.e., <200 cells/mm3) were associated with a higher riskfor the composite endpoint of intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death.This increased risk was observed even in patients who had achieved virologic suppression of HIV.15 Ina large observational cohort study of people with HIV and COVID-19 in the United States, those withCD4 counts <350 cells/mm3 were more likely to be hospitalized, require ventilation, or die. Higherlevels of viremia were also associated with worse outcomes.18 In another study of 175 patients with HIVand COVID-19, a low CD4 count or a low CD4 nadir was associated with poor outcomes.16 In a cohortstudy conducted in New York, people with HIV and COVID-19 had higher rates of hospitalization andmortality than people with COVID-19 who did not have HIV.17Prevention of COVID-19 in People With HIVThe COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) recommends using the same approach foradvising persons with HIV on the strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection that is used for peoplewithout HIV (AIII). There is currently no clear evidence that any antiretroviral (ARV) medications canprevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.People with HIV should receive COVID-19 vaccines, regardless of their CD4 count or HIV viral load,because the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks (AIII). People with HIV were included in theclinical trials of the two mRNA vaccines and the adenovirus vector vaccine that are currently availablethrough Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) and/or approval from the Food and Drug Administration(FDA);20-22 however, the safety and efficacy of these vaccines in people with HIV have not been fullyreported. Typically, people with HIV who are on ART and who have achieved virologic suppressionrespond well to licensed vaccines. Preliminary data from studies that used COVID-19 vaccines in peoplewith HIV confirm that people who are on ART and have normal CD4 counts have good immunologicresponses to the vaccines.23-25Downloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 345On August 12, 2021, the FDA changed the EUAs for the two mRNA vaccines to allow a third dose ofan mRNA vaccine to be administered at least 28 days after the second dose to people with advanced oruntreated HIV. Advanced HIV is defined as people with CD4 counts <200 cells/mm3, a history of anAIDS-defining illness without immune reconstitution, or clinical manifestations of symptomatic HIV.Guidance for using these vaccines, including guidance for people with HIV, is available through theAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practices. A patient\u2019s HIV status should be kept confidential whenadministering a vaccine.People with HIV who have recently been in close contact with a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection areeligible to receive anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP);however, in situations where there are logistical or supply constraints for administering mAbs, priorityshould be given to those with advanced HIV (AIII). See Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 Infection for thespecific indications for PEP.Diagnostic and Laboratory Testing for COVID-19 in People With HIVDiagnosis of COVID-19 in People With HIVThe Panel recommends using the same approach for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection in people withHIV as in those without HIV (AIII).", "student98": "See Testing for SARS-CoV-2 Infection for more information.There is currently no evidence that the performance characteristics of nucleic acid amplification tests(NAATs) differ in people with and without HIV when diagnosing acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. The Panelrecommends against the use of serologic testing as the sole basis for diagnosis of acute SARS-CoV-2infection (AIII). However, if diagnostic serologic testing is performed in a patient with HIV, the resultsshould be interpreted with caution because cross-reactivity between antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and HIVhas been reported.26Correlation of CD4 Count in People With HIV and COVID-19The normal range for CD4 counts in healthy adults is about 500 to 1,600 cells/mm3. People with HIVwho have a CD4 count of \u2265500 cells/mm3 have similar cellular immune function to those without HIV.In people with HIV, a CD4 count <200 cells/mm3 meets the definition for AIDS. For patients on ART, thehallmark of treatment success is plasma HIV RNA below the level of detection by a polymerase chainreaction assay. Lymphopenia is a common laboratory finding in patients with COVID-19; in patients withHIV, clinicians should note that CD4 counts obtained during acute COVID-19 may not accurately reflectthe patient\u2019s HIV disease stage.There have been some reports of people with advanced HIV who have presented with COVID-19 andanother coinfection, including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.27,28 In patients with advanced HIV whohave suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinicians should consider a broaderdifferential diagnosis for clinical symptoms and consider consulting an HIV specialist (AIII).Clinical Presentation of COVID-19 in People With HIVIt is currently unknown whether people with HIV have a higher incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection ora higher rate of progression to symptomatic disease than the general population. Approximately 50% ofpeople with HIV in the United States are aged >50 years,29 and many have comorbidities that are associatedwith more severe cases of COVID-19. These comorbidities include hypertension, diabetes mellitus,cardiovascular disease, tobacco use disorder, chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, and cancer.30There are a number of case reports and case series that describe the clinical presentation of COVID-19in people with HIV.3-10,31,32 These studies indicate that the clinical presentation of COVID-19 is similar inDownloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 346people with and without HIV. Most of the published reports describe populations in which most of theindividuals with HIV are on ART and have achieved virologic suppression. Consequently, the currentunderstanding of the impact of COVID-19 in those with advanced HIV who have low CD4 counts orpersistent HIV viremia is limited.Management of COVID-19 in People With HIVRecommendations for the triage and management of COVID-19 in people with HIV are the same asthose for the general population (AIII).The treatment of COVID-19 in persons with HIV is the same as for those without HIV (AIII).Nonhospitalized people with HIV and mild to moderate COVID-19 are eligible to receive anti-SARSCoV-2 mAbs for treatment; however, in situations where there are logistical or supply constraints foradministering mAbs, priority should be given to those with advanced HIV (AIII). See Prevention ofSARS-CoV-2 Infection for more information. In hospitalized patients, the appropriate treatment strategydepends on disease severity (see Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized Adults With COVID-19).When starting treatment for COVID-19 in patients with HIV, clinicians should pay careful attentionto potential drug-drug interactions and overlapping toxicities among COVID-19 treatments,ARV medications, antimicrobial therapies, and other medications (AIII). Both tocilizumab anddexamethasone, which are recommended for some patients with severe or critical COVID-19,are immunosuppressive agents. The safety of using these drugs in immunocompromised patients,including those with advanced HIV, has not been studied. Therefore, patients with advanced HIV whoare receiving these drugs should be closely monitored for secondary infections.", "student99": "Dexamethasone is adose-dependent inducer of cytochrome P450 3A4, and it could potentially lower the levels of certaincoadministered ARV drugs. More than a single dose of dexamethasone is not recommended for patientswho are receiving rilpivirine as part of their ARV regimen. Clinicians should consult an HIV specialistbefore administering dexamethasone to these patients. It is currently unknown whether administering\u226410 days of dexamethasone impacts the clinical efficacy of other ARV drugs. Patients with HIV whoare receiving dexamethasone as treatment for COVID-19 should follow up with their HIV providers toassess their virologic response.Although some ARV drugs are being studied for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, no agentshave been shown to be effective.People with HIV should be offered the opportunity to participate in clinical trials of vaccines and potentialtreatments for COVID-19. A variety of immunomodulatory therapies are prescribed empirically oradministered as part of a clinical trial to treat severe COVID-19. The data on whether these medicationsare safe to use in patients with HIV are lacking. If a medication has been shown to reduce the mortality ofpatients with COVID-19 in the general population, it should also be used to treat COVID-19 in patientswith HIV, unless data indicate that the medication is not safe or effective in this population.Managing HIV in People With SARS-CoV-2/HIV CoinfectionBelow are some general considerations regarding the management of HIV in people with SARS-CoV-2/HIV coinfection.\u2022 Whenever possible, ART and opportunistic infection prophylaxis should be continued in apatient with HIV who develops COVID-19, including in those who require hospitalization(AIII). Treatment interruption may lead to rebound viremia, and, in some cases, the emergenceof drug resistance. If the appropriate ARV drugs are not on the hospital\u2019s formulary, administermedications from the patient\u2019s home supplies, if available.Downloaded from https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ on 10/28/2021COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 347\u2022 Clinicians who are treating COVID-19 in people with HIV should consult an HIV specialist beforeadjusting or switching a patient\u2019s ARV medications.
